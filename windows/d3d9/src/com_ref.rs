//! Owning cached COM pointer (`CachedComPtr<T, K>`) with RAII refcount.
//!
//! D3D9 makes us hold `AddRef`'d pointers to external COM objects we don't
//! own (the currently-bound render-target surface, vertex buffer at
//! stream 0, etc.). The bookkeeping shape is always the same:
//!
//! - On swap: bump the incoming pointer (if non-null), drop the old one.
//! - On teardown: drop whatever is currently cached.
//!
//! Inline `(*p).vtbl().{add_ref,release}(...)` pairs replicated this at
//! every bound-slot site; refcount correctness leaked to call sites. The
//! type below encodes the invariant: construction (`adopt`) bumps the
//! refcount; `Drop` decrements it. Assignment Drops the old value, so
//! `field = unsafe { CachedComPtr::adopt(new) }` is the swap idiom.
//!
//! The `K: Ownership` type parameter selects the bookkeeping path. Both
//! markers bump the wrapper's device-internal `private_refcount` inline (no
//! vtable indirection, no `ApiTimer` instrumentation), so the application's
//! `AddRef`/`Release` answers only ever count the application's own
//! references:
//!
//! - `Bound` serves the per-draw bind slots (texture stages, bound VB/IB,
//!   render targets, shader slots, vertex declaration).
//! - `Captured` serves the objects a state block captures or records. It
//!   also counts the reference toward the object's `Reset` blocker: a
//!   `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT` object a state block keeps alive is outstanding for
//!   `Reset` as one the application holds is, while a binding never is.

// lifecycle, so the bookkeeping lives here once instead of being re-derived
// (slightly differently) in each per-type `AddRef`/`Release` thunk:
//
//   - `AddRef` bumps the public refcount; on the 0→1 edge it forwards one
//     reference to the owning device (a child keeps its parent device alive
//     for as long as the app holds a public reference).
//   - `Release` drops the public refcount, tolerating release-past-zero
//     (D3D9 permits it); on the 1→0 edge it finalizes the wrapper (unless the
//     object is device- or container-owned and cached), then releases the
//     forwarded device reference *last* — that release may destroy the device.
//

// device for its public lifetime and releases that device reference last,
