//! The PE-side logger's sink: a queue drained by one logging thread.
//!
//! `env_logger` hands every formatted line to [`Sink::write`], which copies
//! the bytes into an unbounded channel without a Unix call or a queue-capacity
//! wait. PE callers pay formatting, a line allocation and a queue push. Native
//! encoder workers use the Unix logger directly instead of this sink.
//! One logging thread drains the queue and forwards each
//! line through the `WriteLog` thunk into the process's log file, which the
//! unix side owns. Lines logged while no thread runs wait in the queue; the
//! queue keeps their order.
//!
//! The thread lives from the first `IDirect3D9` to the last: [`acquire`],
//! from `Direct3DCreate9` (never from `DllMain`, which runs under the loader
//! lock), starts it, and [`release`], from the last interface's drop, stops
//! it and waits for it to be gone. The thread holds a reference on
//! `d3d9.dll` for its lifetime and leaves through `FreeLibraryAndExitThread`,
//! so a `FreeLibrary` cannot unmap the image under a running thread, and one
//! that follows the last `Release` finds no thread of ours in the image.
//! That exit needs the loader lock, so a last `Release` whose caller holds it
//! (another DLL's `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH`, a TLS callback) sends the stop and
//! returns without waiting; the thread's own reference keeps the image mapped
//! until it is gone.
//!
//! [`open`] names that file's location first: the directory `log.dir` picks,
//! or `mtld3d-logs` next to the executable, as a unix path the unix side can
//! create, plus the executable's stem for the file name. The pid in the name
//! is the unix side's own: the one this side sees is Wine's process id, which
//! repeats from one launch to the next.
