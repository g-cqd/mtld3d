//! Shader-library and render-pipeline builds on worker threads.
//!
//! A draw that names a library or pipeline the encoder has never built used
//! to build it on the encoder thread, which stalled the frame for the
//! length of a Metal compile. The encoder now does only the probe, the
//! content key, the warm-cache bridge and the enqueue; a pool of
//! `mtld3d-compile` threads does the MSL emission, the Metal compile or
//! pipeline build and the cache append, and the encoder installs what they
//! hand back at the top of its next frame or draw. The draws that need a
//! build still in flight are left out of the frame when that loses nothing a
//! later frame does not redraw (`mtld3d_core::async_compile::may_skip_draw`).
//! The others bind a placeholder pipeline and the encoder keeps encoding;
//! the submission waits for exactly the builds its placeholders name, and
//! swaps the real pipelines in before any pass rule reads the commands.
