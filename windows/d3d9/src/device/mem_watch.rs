//! Address-space watch for 32-bit games.
//!
//! A large-address-aware i386 process has 4 GiB of virtual address space
//! and every texture streamed, every shader compiled and every one of our
//! staging copies lives inside it. When it runs out, allocations fail and
//! the game usually follows a garbage pointer a few frames later, far from
//! the cause. This watch walks the address space every few presents, sums its
//! usable free regions (`crash::free_space`), and logs one warning per
//! threshold crossed on the way down, of the free total or of the largest free
//! block, with the region map and the page boxes mtld3d holds, so the log says
//! how close the process was and who owned the space.
//!
//! The page boxes are reported by holder (texture staging, surfaces,
//! vertex/index backing, encoder leases, upload leases, the recycle pool)
//! with the rest as `other`, and the texture staging and vertex/index backing
//! are split again by the class that decides whether the copy can be released
//! at all, so the line names which holder keeps the space rather than leaving
//! it to a guess. Beside them goes what `d3d9.dll`'s heap has committed, page
//! boxes included, which bounds everything else the image allocates.
//!
//! The periodic breakdown logs at debug on its own target, so
//! `RUST_LOG=mtld3d::d3d9::mem_watch=debug` turns it on without the rest of
//! the layer's debug output; the threshold warnings log at warn on the same
//! target and show by default. A 64-bit process has no address space to run
//! out of and a slow walk, so it skips the walk and the thresholds and keeps
//! the breakdown, which still says what the layer holds in memory.
