//! Multisample anti-aliasing: the swap chain, standalone surfaces and the resolve.
//!
//! The observable property throughout is coverage. A diagonal edge drawn into a
//! multisampled target resolves to intermediate pixels along the edge; the same
//! draw into a single-sampled target has none, every pixel being fully inside
//! or fully outside. Each test that renders counts those intermediate pixels
//! along one scanline, so nothing depends on where exactly the rasterizer puts
//! the edge or on the device's sample positions.
