//! Cold start with a populated shader cache: fresh processes from launch to their first frame.
//!
//! What a game pays between being launched and showing its first frame once
//! the cache beside it is full: loading `d3d9.dll`, `Direct3DCreate9`,
//! `CreateDevice`, the prewarm thread recreating every recorded shader and
//! pipeline, and the first `Present`. Each measurement needs a process of
//! its own, so the benchmark runs its workload in private copies of this
//! test executable in a directory of their own. The layer keeps
//! `mtld3d_shaders.bin` beside the executable, so the cache is private to
//! the benchmark and its path is known, and the name of each copy says
//! which part it plays.
//!
//! A priming process draws a mix shaped like World of Warcraft 1.12's
//! startup for a few frames under `shaderCache.enable=true`, which fills
//! the cache: [`SM2_PAIRS`] `vs_2_0`/`ps_2_0` pairs and [`FF_COMBOS`]
//! fixed-function combinations, about 100 shaders, each drawn under the
//! four [`BLENDS`], about 200 pipelines. One untimed process then starts on
//! that cache, which compacts it as a game's second launch does, and the
//! compacted file is put back before each of [`RUNS`] measured processes,
//! so every one starts from the same bytes. A measured process creates the
//! device, draws the mix once, presents, and reads the back buffer back,
//! which waits for the encoder and so for the prewarm the encoder waits
//! for. It times each step with the benchmarks' `rdtsc` clock (`TscClock`),
//! calibrated after the last step so its sleep is in none of them, and
//! prints one line the parent parses. The time from launch is the child's
//! wall clock at a step less the parent's just before the spawn, both read
//! from the one host clock, since `rdtsc` counts are not compared across
//! processes. The parent
//! takes the prewarm counts and time from the child's layer log and checks
//! the cache after each run: a record a run appended is a shader or a
//! pipeline the prewarm did not provide.
//!
//! Real caches are measured the same way. `make bench BENCH_CORPUS=...`
//! copies each named cache to `corpus/<name>/mtld3d_shaders.bin` under the
//! report directory, `<name>` the one the Makefile's corpus rule gives it,
//! and each is measured beside a private executable that only clears and
//! presents, so the prewarm of that cache is the work, and reported as
//! `cold_start_<name>`. A corpus whose header names another
//! format or schema than the layer's is one the layer would wipe: it is
//! skipped, and the `cold_start` report says so.
//!
//! The layer under test need not be the build of this binary: `make
//! bench-ab` runs the candidate's binary against the base's layer too. So
//! the format and schema a cache is judged by are the layer's, read from
//! the header of the synthetic cache, which the priming process's layer
//! wrote into an empty directory. The stored and appended record counts
//! need this binary's reader, which decodes only its own schema, so a
//! layer that writes another one gets its timings, its prewarm counts and
//! its cache size reported without those counts, and the report says why.
