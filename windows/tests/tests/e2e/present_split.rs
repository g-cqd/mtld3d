//! The submit thread commits the frame; a presenter per device presents it.
//!
//! A present queues a packet the unix-side presenter turns into a drawable
//! acquisition and a present command buffer of its own, after the frame's
//! render command buffer has committed. The render buffer never waits for a
//! drawable, so a read-back that flushes the frame in progress completes
//! while the presenter is parked, and one device's parked presenter leaves
//! another device presenting. `debug.presentGateFile` is the seam: while the
//! file exists the presenter blocks before acquiring a drawable, and a test
//! holds it exactly across the read-back it wants to see complete. With the
//! gate inside the one thunk that replays, acquires and commits, the flush
//! behind the read-back drains a submit thread parked there, the read-back
//! never returns, and the harness reports the test as a timeout rather than
//! as a wrong pixel. The same seam holds a read-back behind a full pipeline:
//! every stage ahead of the presenter filled with a present, which is the
//! most copies one read-back can need and what the slot array is sized for.
