//! Passes whose draws leave the colour target unwritten.
//!
//! Such a pass, with a depth attachment and no colour `Clear` of its own,
//! goes to the GPU with no colour attachment at all and its pipelines swapped
//! for no-colour variants. The colour target then has to come out of it
//! holding exactly what it held going in, whichever view of it the pass
//! would have bound: the sRGB view that `D3DRS_SRGBWRITEENABLE` selects, or
//! the multisampled surface behind a multisampled target. A view left
//! attached disagrees with the no-colour pipeline (the validation layer the
//! suite runs under rejects the draw) and discards its contents on store.
//!
//! Leaving the colour target out must not change the area the pass
//! rasterizes, with one exception: a 1x1 render target 0, alone and
//! unwritten, over a larger depth surface. There the draws reach the whole
//! depth surface, whether or not the target was cleared, whether the pass
//! also has draws that write it, and whether the pixel shader or the write
//! mask leaves it unwritten; a colour `Clear` still reaches the 1x1 target,
//! and a depth `Clear` bounded by a scissor reaches the part of the depth
//! surface it names. A 2x2 target keeps its own 2x2 area, and a depth surface
//! that `render.scale` reduces keeps the 1x1 area.
//!
//! A depth or stencil `Clear` through any colour target smaller than the
//! depth surface reaches what D3D9 clears, the viewport or the rects on the
//! depth surface, whatever the colour target's size: pending until the next
//! pass, after draws, by rect, by a viewport reaching past the target, with a
//! render target 1 of the same size, and in a 1x1 and 1x2 shape under a
//! 640x640 viewport.
