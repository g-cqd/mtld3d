//! The end-to-end suite, one test binary so one Wine process runs it all.
//!
//! Every module here drives the real `d3d9.dll` through the shared
//! [`mtld3d_tests::Harness`], and the tests of all of them run on the
//! threads of this one process, each with its own device. The five files
//! that stay outside are the ones that need a process of their own:
//! `exit_code.rs` ends the process it runs in, `unload.rs` frees the
//! library, so nothing else may keep it mapped, `unload_after_device.rs`
//! frees it after a device has pinned it and ends the process it runs in,
//! `snmalloc_drift.rs` installs its own global allocator, and
//! `thread_exit.rs` reads the process-wide pool of allocators, which other
//! tests' threads would stir.
//! `COVERAGE.md` indexes the modules; this file only declares them.
