//! Several devices alive at once, each on its own window.

//! paths that look a record up: interleaved presents past the interval at
//! which the presenting thread asks the main thread for a display
//! reconciliation, a teardown beside a device that keeps presenting, and an
//! attach beside a device that is already live. The last two tests move the
//! devices onto two threads: one where each device's wait for its own frame
//! meets the other's submissions in the unix-side registry of in-flight
//! command buffers, and one where two devices under `render.scale` read back
//! at once, so each device's readback resolve has to run in a scratch texture
//! of its own.
