//! A synthetic frame shaped like World of Warcraft 3.3.5a's busy frame, timed over many frames.
//!
//! The shape follows a frame the game drew under the layer, taken from the
//! layer's F12 `[dump]` of one 2026-09 session (three dumped frames, each
//! the same 1323 draws), and the call mix follows a busy window of the
//! layer's `PERF=1` summary from another session of the same build, a
//! five-second window as the summary had then (601 frames of about 1420
//! draws and ten passes each).
//!
//! One frame is 1323 draws in ten render passes. Five shadow-cascade passes
//! of 8, 120, 158, 382 and 143 caster draws render into one shared 2048x2048
//! A8R8G8B8 colour target with colour writes off, each beside a D24X8 depth
//! texture of its own; binding the targets resets the scissor rectangle, so
//! each pass clears both over the whole target and then draws under a
//! scissor band of its own. The targets are bound through the back buffer
//! the way the game does, six target binds a cascade. About a third of the
//! casters sample a DXT texture and `texkill` on its alpha. The scene pass
//! on the back buffer, which the frame clears before the cascades, is 411
//! draws in the dumped frame's order: opaque runs, a block alternating a
//! source-alpha-times-zero pair with an inverse-source-alpha-plus-one pair,
//! three fixed-function sky draws in a viewport of their own depth range,
//! long opaque runs, middle runs of which 14 draws also sample a DXT1
//! detail texture on stage 1, and a blended tail of 146 draws cycling an
//! alpha-blended pair with two additive ones, the last of them particles
//! from a dynamic vertex buffer. Its 408 programmable draws sample a DXT1,
//! DXT5, DXT3 or (four of them) uncompressed texture on stage 0 and four
//! cascade depth textures on stages 4 to 7, read as hardware shadow maps
//! (stage 4 alternates between the two nearest cascades), 2056 textures in
//! all with the sky's, through 27 pairs of 17 vertex and 17 pixel programs
//! in 214 runs; 179 draws blend, 104 of them additively. A 1:1 `StretchRect`
//! copies the back buffer; three one-draw glow passes at a quarter of its
//! size ping-pong between two targets beside a 2048x2048 D24S8 surface,
//! through the fixed-function vertex pipeline and four-tap pixel programs;
//! the UI pass on the back buffer is the glow composite, 95 programmable
//! quads, each written into the dynamic buffer with its own
//! `D3DLOCK_NOOVERWRITE` lock, and two fixed-function minimap draws in a
//! viewport of their own, then `Present`. Where D24X8 depth textures are
//! not offered, the cascades render into D24X8 surfaces and the scene
//! samples a stand-in DXT texture on those stages instead; the metrics file
//! says which with `meta <bench> depth_path d24x8` or `dxt_standin`.
//!
//! Per draw the frame makes about 0.64 `SetTexture`, 0.63
//! `SetVertexShaderConstantF`, 0.12 `SetPixelShaderConstantF`, 0.29
//! `SetRenderState`, 0.23 `SetSamplerState`, 1.01 stream and index binds
//! and 0.17 and 0.12 vertex and pixel program binds (the game's window:
//! 0.65, 0.65, 0.14, 0.28, 0.25, 1.08, 0.15 and 0.15), and per frame 44
//! target binds, as the game does, about 40 declaration binds and about
//! 150 buffer locks, with no queries and no `SetFVF`. Programs,
//! declarations and render states are set only when they change; the blend
//! factors change while blending is off, so opaque draws carry stale ones.
//! Every program is created up front and first drawn in the warm-up, so the
//! measured frames compile nothing.
//!
//! The metrics file carries one `shape` record per pass, computed from the
//! constants and the run list below rather than read back from the layer.
