//! Frame time when every frame waits on the EVENT query of the frame before it.
//!
//! Guards the cost of an EVENT-query throttle. World of Warcraft's "Reduce
//! Input Lag" option (`gxFixLag`, on by default) issues an EVENT query each
//! frame and spins on `GetData(D3DGETDATA_FLUSH)` until the previous one
//! answers, to keep the CPU from running ahead of the GPU. When that answer
//! waits for the GPU to retire the frame, the CPU and GPU stop overlapping:
//! 3.3.5a loses about 40% of its frame rate that way, with unchanged GPU time
//! per frame. The built-in `wow` profile therefore sets
//! `query.eventImmediate=true` (and `query.flushImmediate=true`), and a
//! change that makes the throttled frame slower, the poll dearer or the
//! answer late again shows here first.
//!
//! Both tests draw the same light frame: about 300 textured `vs_2_0`/`ps_2_0`
//! draws in ten material runs, then two small flare quads, each inside an
//! occlusion query that the next frame reads with `GetData(0)`, no FLUSH, as
//! the game reads its lens-flare queries. At the end of every frame, before
//! `Present`, the frame issues its EVENT query and then polls the previous
//! frame's with `D3DGETDATA_FLUSH` until it answers `S_OK`, counting the
//! calls and timing, with the benchmarks' `rdtsc` clock (`TscClock`), the span
//! from that query's `Issue` to the answer. The span includes the frame
//! between them, so under the `wow` keys, where the first poll answers, it
//! is about one frame; on the spec path it runs to the GPU's retirement of
//! the frame the query was issued in.
//!
//! `query_poll_wow` passes the built-in `wow` profile's settings, read from
//! `mtld3d-core` so the benchmark follows the profile, as harness
//! configuration: the profile matches `WoW.exe` by its version strings and
//! never this executable. Under it the first poll answers, so its poll
//! counts are exact and any other count means the immediate answer is
//! gone; on the spec path a cheaper poll spins more often, so there they
//! are context only. `query_poll_spec` pins both keys to their
//! defaults, stated explicitly so a suite-wide `BENCH_CONFIG` cannot move
//! them. `query.flushImmediate` changes only an occlusion read that passes
//! the FLUSH flag, which these two frames never do; it is set in the `wow`
//! test only so the test runs what the profile runs.
//!
//! `query_flush_read_spec` runs the spec frame with the occlusion reads
//! passing `D3DGETDATA_FLUSH`, the pattern of a title that culls by the
//! counts it waits for (Grand Theft Auto IV's coronas). Each read waits for
//! the GPU to retire the previous frame, whose END a Present already sent, so
//! it guards what such a wait costs the frame being recorded.
