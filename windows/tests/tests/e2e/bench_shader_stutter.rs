//! Frame-time spikes from pixel shaders that first appear mid-game, with the shader cache off.
//!
//! Every measured frame draws a fixed base workload and then creates and
//! draws never-seen programmable pixel shaders: `K` on the back buffer, one
//! quad each, and, in the variants that ask for it, more in one pass into an
//! offscreen target that is cleared once and never again, so its pass loads
//! what the previous frame left and the draws must keep their content. Each
//! shader's bytecode is unique (its `def c7` carries a running count and a
//! per-run salt), so neither the layer nor Metal's own compiler cache can
//! have seen it, on this run or an earlier one. The interface is created
//! with `shaderCache.enable=false` on top of whatever the suite-wide
//! configuration carries, which is how `make bench BENCH_CONFIG=...` tries
//! other options against the same frames.
//!
//! The warm-up draws the base workload alone, for at least
//! [`WARM_UP_FRAMES`] and until a readback of the back buffer shows its
//! draws. With the cache off the base shaders are new too. When no earlier
//! benchmark in the process has built them and Metal's own compiler cache
//! does not hold them, their builds take tens of milliseconds, longer than
//! the fixed warm-up and the measured frames together, and a layer that
//! leaves draws out while their builds are in flight would then run the
//! measured frames without the base draws, which a game whose scene has
//! been on screen for a while never does.
//!
//! The measured frames are the `MEASURED_FRAMES` that introduce shaders.
//! Base frames follow until [`IDLE_TAIL`] has passed without a new shader
//! and a `PERF=1` build has written one whole summary window inside the span
//! (a build that writes none has shown none within a window of the span's
//! start), or at most until the span has run [`MIN_SPAN`], so any account of
//! compiles that waits for a quiet spell has had one; the report copies the Compilation rows of
//! every window in the span, which is where a layer that skips draws whose
//! pipeline is not ready says how many it skipped and how long installs
//! took. Nothing the measured frames draw is there to be checked, so the
//! check changes nothing they measure: after the settle frames, verification
//! frames clear a probe target and draw every new shader into a 4x4 cell of
//! its own, and a readback says whether each cell shows the shader's
//! colour, until every one does or [`VERIFY_FRAMES`] have gone by. A layer
//! that skips a draw for a pipeline still building has had the settle
//! frames to build it, so a cell left black is a shader that was never
//! drawn. `K` and the offscreen count are fixed per test; `make bench
//! FILTER=<test name>` picks one.
