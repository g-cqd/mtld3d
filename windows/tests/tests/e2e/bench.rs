//! Support shared by the synthetic benchmarks, which `make bench` runs and `make test` skips.
//!
//! No test of its own. The benchmarks, one or more in each `bench_*.rs`
//! beside this file, are `#[ignore]`d: they take seconds each and
//! their numbers depend on the machine and on whatever else it is running,
//! so they measure and report instead of asserting, and the ordinary suite
//! lists them as ignored. `make bench` runs them alone, one at a time in one
//! process, through the runner's `--ignored`.
//!
//! Each benchmark writes a plain-text report, `bench-<name>.txt`, into the
//! directory the layer writes its log to (`log.dir`, which `make bench`
//! points at its output directory), and beside it `bench-<name>.metrics`,
//! the same numbers one record per line for a program to compare (see
//! [`Metrics`]). On a `PERF=1` build the report carries the rows of the
//! layer's two-second `mtld3d::perf` summary that cover the measured frames,
//! copied out of that log, and the metrics file the counters of the `perf-kv`
//! line the layer logs after each of them. Frame times are taken on the API
//! thread from one `Present` return to the next with [`TscClock`], the
//! layer's own `rdtsc` primitive at its calibrated rate (under Wine
//! `QueryPerformanceCounter` ticks at 100 ns and costs a call into `ntdll`),
//! and the device presents with `D3DPRESENT_INTERVAL_IMMEDIATE` so the
//! display does not pace it. Beside that the report gives the time from a
//! `Present` return to the next `Present` call, the API thread's own work on
//! the frame, which tells a frame bound by the API thread from one bound
//! behind `Present`. Each benchmark also samples the process's address space
//! before it creates its interface, after its warm-up and at the end of its
//! measured frames, and its peak working set; what it adds since the first
//! sample is what a comparison judges ([`Metrics::memory`]).
//!
//! The measured frames start where a perf window opens and last one window
//! ([`SpanStart::length`]), so a `PERF=1` build's metrics come from one
//! whole window with no warm-up frame in it, covering approximately the
//! measured frames: the span starts when the window's opening shows in the
//! log, a poll and the log thread's latency after it, and a frame floor can
//! make it outlast the window. The layer opens a device's first window at
//! its first frame and closes each after its interval, so after its warm-up
//! a benchmark runs unmeasured frames until the log shows the grid of the
//! window the warm-up began in ([`LayerLog::start_span`]), measures from
//! there for as long as that window lasted, and after the span runs
//! unmeasured frames again until the window it measured has written its own
//! ([`SpanStart::end`]). The length is read from the log, the `perf-kv`
//! line's `window_s` or the grid header's `window=`, not from this binary's
//! own layer build: `make bench-ab` runs this binary against a base whose
//! windows may be longer (5 s before they became 2 s). A log that already
//! holds perf windows is waited on for up to two of its windows, and one
//! that does not close then fails the benchmark, since a round without its
//! window would lack the metrics the others carry. A log with none
//! [`NO_WINDOW_WAIT`] after the first frame belongs to a build that writes
//! none (or a run whose filter hides them), which then measures
//! [`PERF_WINDOW`] from wherever the wait stopped.
