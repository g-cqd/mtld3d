//! The status a process ends with survives the detach that kills it.
//!
//! `d3d9.dll` ends a process that has created a device from the
//! `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH` of its exit (it cannot survive the allocator's
//! thread-local teardown on Wine's 1 MB main-thread stack), and the code of
//! that `TerminateProcess` is the one the unix side of Wine exits with, so a
//! status the process named itself has to be carried into it. Nothing inside
//! the process can read its own unix exit status, so the assertion belongs
//! to the runner: the test creates a device, declares on stdout the code it
//! is about to end with, and ends with it through the `ExitProcess` import
//! of this binary, and `unix/e2e` fails the test unless the process ended
//! exactly there.
//!
//! It is a binary of its own because it ends the process it runs in, and it
//! uses the shared harness on purpose: a static import is what puts
//! `d3d9.dll` in the process before the exit, which is the shape a game has.
