//! Built-in per-application configuration profiles.
//!
//! A few games need an option set no user should have to discover: an adapter
//! identity their engine branches on, a capability they must not be told about,
//! an era-driver behaviour their renderer was written against. A profile carries
//! those values for one executable so the game runs correctly out of the box.
//!
//! A profile is the weakest configuration layer. `mtld3d.conf` and
//! `MTLD3D_CONFIG` both beat it key by key, so a user can take one option back
//! without losing the rest of the profile.
//!
//! A profile is keyed by the version resource the vendor linked into the image,
//! not by a path, so it follows the game wherever it is installed and cannot
//! catch an unrelated program that happens to share a file name.
//!
//! Pure logic: the PE side supplies the executable's name and the raw
//! `VS_VERSIONINFO` blob, so everything here is host-testable.
