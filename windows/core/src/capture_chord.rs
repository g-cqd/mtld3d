//! The Ctrl+Shift+P chord that arms the three-frame dump and the Metal GPU capture.
//!
//! The chord is on a letter because no Ctrl+Shift function-key chord is free:
//! a bare F12 is Steam's default screenshot key, the Metal performance HUD's
//! menu takes Shift+F8 to Shift+F12 and Ctrl+Shift+F9 to Ctrl+Shift+F12, and
//! macOS takes its Ctrl+F1 to Ctrl+F8 keyboard-navigation shortcuts even with
//! Shift held. P sits at the same place on QWERTY, QWERTZ and AZERTY, so its
//! virtual-key code does not move with the layout. The trigger is P with
//! Control and Shift held and Alt up. It is fixed: no configuration key and
//! no environment variable moves it.
//!
//! The keys are sampled once per `Present`, so a press is read from two
//! consecutive samples. The chord fires when the capture key is up at one
//! sample and down at the next while, at that next sample, Control and Shift
//! are down and Alt is up. Consequences:
//!
//! - Holding the chord fires once; releasing the key and pressing it again
//!   with the modifiers still held fires again.
//! - Pressing Control and Shift after the key is already down never fires,
//!   since the key made no transition at the sample that first sees the
//!   modifiers.
//! - Keys that all go down between the same two presents count as pressed
//!   together, whatever their order, and a chord pressed and released
//!   entirely between two presents is not seen.
//!
//! The modifiers are read only on the sample where the key goes down, so the
//! steady-state cost is the one key read.
