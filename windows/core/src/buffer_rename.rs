//! Pure decision helper for VB/IB `Lock` contention handling.
//!
//! `plan_lock` serves only `Direct` (DYNAMIC) buffers — see
//! [`classify_map_mode`]. Their backing is CPU-placed memory the GPU
//! reads directly at command-buffer execution time, so overwriting bytes
//! while a prior submit is still in flight would corrupt draws the GPU
//! hasn't reached yet. Non-DYNAMIC buffers are `Staged`: they write a
//! separate CPU staging buffer and upload only the dirtied range to a
//! device buffer on Unlock, so they never reach `plan_lock`.
//!
//! Rename only when there's no other option. The decision tree:
//! - `D3DLOCK_NOOVERWRITE` / `D3DLOCK_READONLY`, or uncontended
//!   (`last_submit_seq <= coherent_seq`): `WriteInPlace`.
//! - `D3DLOCK_DISCARD`: Rename, no preserve (game promised the old
//!   bytes are gone).
//! - Whole-buffer contended: Rename, because the game has access to
//!   every byte and might overwrite anything the GPU is currently
//!   reading. Preserve the old contents only if the buffer wasn't
//!   created `D3DUSAGE_WRITEONLY` (game might read what it didn't
//!   write).
//! - Partial non-DISCARD contended: `WriteInPlace`. The (DYNAMIC) game
//!   opted into the "I manage timing" contract (DISCARD/NOOVERWRITE
//!   discipline), the same one non-persistent mapped-buffer APIs (e.g.
//!   OpenGL `glBufferSubData`) make implicitly. Append-only UI batchers
//!   live here; renaming them on every call drives
//!   memory-allocation-failure symptoms. D3D9 promises no such thing on
//!   a plain Lock, so this arm is a deliberate divergence:
//!   `docs/STATUS.md#kept-divergences` lists it and
//!   `unix/conformance/CONFORMANCE.md` carries its conformance-site
//!   rationale. It is also the only arm with no other side effect, so
//!   `d3d9` counts it into a perf row.
//!
//! `Staged` buffers get their own two rules here. `records_dirty_range`
//! decides whether a `Lock` widens the pending-upload range at all, which
//! is where `D3DLOCK_READONLY` is honoured, and only in the pool that
//! gives it meaning. `may_trust_lock_bounds`
//! then decides whether the `[OffsetToLock, SizeToLock)` window a title
//! announces bounds the bytes it actually writes, and therefore whether
//! the Unlock upload can be narrowed to that window or has to carry the
//! whole buffer. It answers yes for an ordinary lock unless
//! `buffer.ignoreLockBounds` is set, because a whole-buffer range here is
//! not a wider memcpy but a rename; it answers no either way for the two
//! lock shapes that name no narrower window, `D3DLOCK_DISCARD` and a zero
//! `SizeToLock`.
//!
//! Side effects (allocate `PageBox`, sync memcpy preserve, queue
//! retention, bump perf counters) stay in `d3d9`; this module just
//! returns a verdict.
