//! Uploads the encoder never emitted, on their way back into the dirty state.
//!
//! A texture upload is scheduled on the API thread: the flush takes the
//! level's dirty bit and its pending rect, builds a job and hands it to the
//! encoder thread. Every step past that hand-off can still decline to emit
//! anything: the destination texture may fail to create, the staging wrapper
//! may fail, a padded repack may fail, and a texel-widening expansion has no
//! blit that could stand in for the pass it needs. The dirty state is already
//! gone by then, and `UnlockRect` publishes only the rectangle the game
//! locked, so nothing re-announces the region: the mip keeps whatever it held
//! until the game happens to write those texels again.
//!
//! This queue closes that gap. The encoder records the subresource and the
//! rectangle of every upload it did not emit; the API thread drains the queue
//! once a frame and marks each one dirty again, so the next bind retries.
//! Retries are bounded per subresource, because a decline with a permanent
//! cause repeats on every attempt and an unbounded retry would schedule a
//! failing upload on every draw that binds the texture.
//!
//! The queue carries the other answer too. A texture whose class releases a
//! level's staging once the GPU holds every byte of it may only do so after
//! an upload actually reached the command stream: released early, a declined
//! upload has no bytes left to retry from and the level stays empty. So the
//! encoder names every upload it did emit whose level is waiting on that
//! answer, and the same drain performs the release. Two things hold the
//! release back. A decline filed for the subresource cancels it, because the
//! retry reads the staging again, and the upload number the answer carries
//! lets the drain leave the pages alone while a later upload of the level is
//! still waiting for an answer of its own.
//!
//! Pure bookkeeping: no Metal handles, no D3D9 objects, so the whole contract
//! is host-testable.
