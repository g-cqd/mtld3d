//! Decision helpers for per-mip texture staging: the Lock action and the release class.
//!
//! Mirrors `crate::buffer_rename::plan_lock`'s structure for textures.
//! Same well-behaved-game no-overlap contract VB/IB now relies on —
//! the locked sub-rect doesn't overlap with bytes any in-flight blit
//! reads. Same contract that non-persistent mapped-buffer APIs (e.g.
//! OpenGL `glBufferSubData`) make implicitly; UI atlas regen via
//! whole-mip Locks and DISCARD-heavy geometry texture uploads both
//! satisfy it in practice.
//!
//! Decision tree:
//! - `D3DLOCK_NOOVERWRITE` / `D3DLOCK_READONLY`, or uncontended
//!   (no in-flight or replayable upload): `WriteInPlace`.
//! - `D3DLOCK_DISCARD` on a whole-mip Lock of a `D3DPOOL_DEFAULT`
//!   texture: Rename, no preserve (game promised the old bytes are
//!   gone). Every other DISCARD is dropped first, see
//!   [`honoured_lock_flags`].
//! - Whole-mip contended: Rename + CPU-memcpy preserve. The game may
//!   read every byte through the Lock pointer, and D3D9 hands it the
//!   level's current contents whatever the texture's usage says.
//! - Partial contended, compressed AND not block-aligned: Rename + Cpu
//!   preserve — see `rect_block_aligned` for the formula and why
//!   preserve is forced.
//! - Partial contended, otherwise (uncompressed or block-aligned):
//!   `WriteInPlace`. Relies on the well-behaved-game no-overlap contract.
//!
//! Why `D3DUSAGE_DYNAMIC` has no say: `plan_lock` keys the buffer
//! equivalent on `D3DUSAGE_WRITEONLY`, the spec-documented "no readback"
//! hint for `CreateVertexBuffer` / `CreateIndexBuffer`. `CreateTexture`
//! documents no such hint. DYNAMIC only makes a default-pool level
//! lockable and DISCARD legal on it; a plain Lock of a dynamic texture
//! still sees the level's contents, as D3D9 specifies for every lockable
//! resource. A game that locks a whole dynamic page and rewrites a few
//! blocks of it (a lightmap page under animated light styles) relies on
//! exactly that, so the whole-mip arm preserves regardless of usage.
//!
//! Why no GPU preserve path: `copyFromBuffer:toTexture:` only writes
//! the locked sub-rect, leaving prior `MTLTexture` pixels intact. The
//! GPU side preserves outside-rect pixels automatically. The Cpu
//! preserve only matters when the GAME reads bytes outside its
//! written rect through the Lock pointer (whole-mip locks), or when
//! the encoder's compressed-fallback is forced to read more bytes
//! than the rect (the alignment-guard arm).
//!
//! Side effects (allocate `PageBox`, sync memcpy preserve, queue
//! retention, bump perf counters) stay in `d3d9::texture`; this
//! module just returns a verdict.
//!
//! [`staging_droppable_class`] answers the other staging question, the
//! one asked after an upload rather than before a write: whether a
//! texture is of a class whose levels may release their staging at all.
