//! Pure parts of building shader libraries and render pipelines off the encoder thread.
//!
//! The encoder hands a library or pipeline it has never built to a pool of
//! worker threads and keeps encoding. A draw that needs a build still in
//! flight is either left out of the frame or waited for, and the choice
//! turns on whether leaving it out can lose content for good. This module
//! holds the logic that choice and the queue rest on, without the threads:
//! the job tickets, the two-lane queue, the record of which attachments
//! recent frames cleared, the skip predicate, and the records of the draws
//! whose pipeline is bound as a placeholder until their submission waits
//! for it.
