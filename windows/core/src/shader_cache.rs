//! On-disk shader and render-pipeline cache in `mtld3d_shaders.bin` next to the host EXE.
//!
//! Each successful MSL or render-pipeline compile appends one *Single* chunk.
//! The startup prewarm thread recreates the recorded objects and atomically
//! compacts the file into one *Bundle* chunk when needed.
//!
//! ## File layout (v19)
//!
//! ```text
//! [file header  16B]  MTLD3DSH | format u32 LE | shader/translation schema u32 LE
//! [chunk]*
//! ```
//!
//! Each chunk has a 24-byte plaintext header followed by a zstd frame:
//!
//! ```text
//! [1B kind | 3B _pad | 8B key u64 LE | 4B frame_len u32 LE | 8B xxh3 u64 LE]
//! [frame: frame_len bytes]
//! ```
//!
//! * `kind` ∈ `0..=7` (`CachedKind`) → **Single** chunk. Frame decompresses to
//!   an emitter fingerprint (u64 LE), a source-present byte, optional DXSO
//!   and specialization inputs, then UTF-8 MSL. `key` is the `disk_key`.
//!   Stale programmable MSL is regenerated; stale source-less records are dropped.
//! * `kind == RECORD_KIND_PIPELINE` (`0xFE`) → **Single** pipeline recipe.
//!   The recipe contains stable shader references and explicit logical fields,
//!   never runtime handles or Rust struct memory.
//! * `kind == RECORD_KIND_BUNDLE` (`0xFF`) → **Bundle** chunk. Frame
//!   decompresses to a concatenation of plain records
//!   (`[1B kind|3B _pad|8B key|4B body_len][body]`, repeated). No inner
//!   checksum: the whole bundle frame is covered by the outer chunk's xxh3.
//! * `xxh3` = `xxh3_64` over `chunk_header[0..16] ++ frame_bytes`. Computed
//!   once at write, verified on read. Mismatch stops parsing because the
//!   length may be corrupt. This mechanism already covers the
//!   frame body, so zstd's own per-frame checksum is left off as redundant.
//!
//! Robustness comes from the plaintext `frame_len` prefix plus the xxh3:
//! torn writes (frame runs past EOF) ⇒ `break`; xxh3 mismatch ⇒ `break`;
//! decompress failure or bad UTF-8 ⇒ skip; unknown `kind` ⇒ skip via
//! `frame_len` (forward-compat hook); a file header found where a chunk
//! header belongs ⇒ skip its 16 bytes.
//!
//! This module owns the binary format and the creation of the file that
//! holds it, both pure-Rust and host-testable. Encoder-side write hooks
//! and pre-warm-thread plumbing live in `windows/d3d9`.

/// Bumped for incompatible shader keys or pipeline-translation semantics.
///
/// A cache file with a different schema is wiped and rebuilt from scratch.
/// Pipeline recipes share this schema because unchanged recipe bytes can
/// describe different Metal state after a translation-rule change.
///
/// `14` adds `VariantKey::depth_sampler_mask` to the PS variant tuple
/// (sampleable shadow-map support). Pre-existing PS records hash with
/// the old key shape and would mis-resolve once the new emitter starts
/// producing `depth2d<float>` bindings, so the cache must be wiped.
///
/// `15` switches depth-bound sampler call sites from `sample()` to
/// `sample_compare()` (D3D9 hardware-shadow PCF). The MSL text differs
/// for every PS with `depth_sampler_mask != 0`, so the cache must be
/// wiped again.
///
/// `16` `saturate`s the `sample_compare` reference to `[0, 1]`. Apple Silicon
/// promotes every depth format to `Depth32Float`, which — unlike the D24
/// UNORM the game authored for — does not clamp the comparison reference;
/// the emitted MSL gains a `saturate(...)` for every depth-bound tap.
///
/// `17` switches the on-disk format to zstd-compressed chunks with a
/// per-chunk xxh3 checksum (Single chunks for appends, one Bundle chunk
/// for the post-pre-warm compacted form). Pre-existing v16 files are
/// plaintext and unparseable under v17, so the schema-mismatch path wipes
/// them.
///
/// `21` moves the FF VS fog params from `vs_c[54]` to `vs_c[8]` (shifting
/// material rows 8..13 → 9..14 and per-light rows 14..53 → 15..54) and
/// replaces the per-slot `light_types: [u8; 8]` on `FfVsKey` with the
/// `light_active_mask` + `light_directional_mask` pair. Emitted MSL +
/// key bytes both change; old-version entries are unreusable.
///
/// `22` FF PS emits `depth2d<float>` + `sample_compare` for depth-format
/// sampler slots (`depth_sampler_mask`), matching the programmable PS path.
///
/// `23` FF PS honors the `D3DTA_ALPHAREPLICATE` / `D3DTA_COMPLEMENT` texture-arg
/// modifiers (previously dropped) and emits `D3DTOP_DOTPRODUCT3`. The MSL text
/// differs for any stage using those, so pre-`23` records must be wiped.
///
/// `24` adds `FfPsKey::specular_add` (the D3D9 end-of-cascade specular add)
/// and `D3DTA_SPECULAR` resolution, and the FF VS passes a declared vertex
/// COLOR1 through `color1` on the unlit/XYZRHW paths (previously hardwired
/// to zero). Key bytes and MSL text both change.
///
/// `25` grows the FF VS per-light constant stride from 5 to 6 rows (the new
/// `+5` row carries the light's specular color, replacing the previous
/// lightDiffuse weighting of the specular term), shifting the texture-
/// transform block 55→63 and the blend palette 87→95. MSL text changes for
/// every lit/TT/blend key; key bytes are unchanged.
///
/// `26` adds `FfVsKey::light_spot_mask` and the spot cone factor (SPOT
/// previously collapsed to DIRECTIONAL): the emitter gains the rho/penumbra
/// block, and the pack side carries spot scale/offset in the ambient and
/// specular rows' .w lanes. Key bytes and MSL text both change.
///
/// `27` adds `FfVsFlags::LOCAL_VIEWER` (`D3DRS_LOCALVIEWER`): the specular
/// view vector becomes the constant infinite-viewer direction when the RS
/// is FALSE instead of always `normalize(-posEye)`. Key bytes and MSL text
/// both change for lit + specular keys.
///
/// `28` the unlit FF VS defaults a missing COLOR0 stream to opaque white
/// (the D3D9 missing-DIFFUSE default) instead of the material diffuse
/// constant. MSL text changes for unlit keys without COLOR0.
///
/// `29` the programmable VS emitter default-initialises out.color0 to opaque
/// white and out.color1 to black, so a shader that omits oD0/oD1 yields the
/// D3D9 spec defaults instead of undefined varyings.
///
/// `30` the FF VS vertex-blend implicit last-weight contribution reads the
/// world-matrix palette at row 95 (was 87, off by 8 rows / 2 bones), matching
/// the explicit-weight loop and the encoder upload base.
///
/// `31` the FF VS texture-coordinate transform is rewritten to the D3D9
/// fixed-function rule: dimension-aware input masking (unbacked components
/// fill 0, not 1), `D3DTTFF_COUNT2..4` expand-and-matrix-multiply with
/// component-count masking, `COUNT1`/`DISABLE`/garbage pass through
/// untransformed, `PROJECTED` stashes the projective divisor in `.w`, and
/// `CAMERASPACENORMAL` texgen uses the un-normalized eye-space normal.
///
/// `32` the FF PS applies the `D3DTTFF_PROJECTED` projective divide — for a
/// projected stage it samples at `texcoord.xy / texcoord.w` (origin when
/// `.w == 0`) instead of `texcoord.xy`.
///
/// `33` SM1 pixel shaders route `r0` to the colour output — `ps_1_x` has no
/// `D3DSPR_COLOROUT` register, so the final pixel colour is whatever the shader
/// left in `r0`; previously such shaders returned the `oC0` float4(0.0) default.
///
/// `34` FF lighting runs without a vertex normal — emissive and ambient (global
/// and per-light) are normal-independent, so a lit draw with no normal now
/// emits them instead of skipping lighting entirely. Only the per-light N·L
/// diffuse/specular terms are gated on the normal.
///
/// `35` `texdepth` (`ps_1_4`) emits the D3D9 reference formula
/// `saturate(r.x / min(r.y, 1.0))` (divisor clamped to 1.0, no `r.y == 0`
/// special-case) instead of the previous guarded `r.x / r.y`.
///
/// `36` relative constant addressing (`c[a0 + N]`) overlays `def`-declared
/// constants via a lookup helper instead of reading the uniform buffer alone —
/// a `def`'d register the app never uploaded previously read zero.
///
/// `37` `texldp` (`D3DSI_TEXLD_PROJECT`) divides the SM2+ `texld` coordinate by
/// its `.w` before sampling; the modifier was previously dropped so a projected
/// sample collapsed to the unprojected one.
///
/// `38` `cnd` honours the shader version and `D3DSI_COISSUE`: `ps_1_4` compares
/// per component, and a co-issued non-alpha `ps_1_1`..`1_3` `cnd` selects src1
/// unconditionally (previously every `cnd` ran the scalar `.x > 0.5` compare).
///
/// `39` the Varyings struct gains a `position1` user varying so a secondary
/// POSITION semantic (`dcl_positionN`, N>=1) survives VS→PS instead of
/// clobbering the clip-space `[[position]]`. Shifts every later varying's
/// positional index, so VS and PS MSL both change.
///
/// `40` fog enabled with both vertex and table fog modes `D3DFOG_NONE` takes
/// the per-vertex fog factor from the specular (COLOR1) alpha (`fog_mode` 4)
/// rather than disabling fog.
///
/// `41` `nrm` scales all written components by 1/length(src.xyz) (was a
/// hardcoded `w = 1.0`); SM1/SM2 VS epilogue saturates the colour outputs
/// (oD0/oD1) to `[0, 1]` like fixed-function, SM3 unchanged.
///
/// `42` FF PS "invalid op" rewrite: a texture stage with no bound texture whose
/// colour/alpha op consumes a `D3DTA_TEXTURE` arg now resolves to
/// SELECTARG1(CURRENT) (was opaque white), per the D3D9 spec.
///
/// `43` raw-depth-fetch samplers: INTZ/DF24/DF16 (`depth_fetch_mask`) read the
/// raw stored depth via `.sample()` instead of `sample_compare` (the implicit
/// depth formats stay comparison shadow samplers).
///
/// `46` `ps_1_x` float-constant clamp: `def` constants and `cN`/`ps_c[N]` reads
/// in a `ps_1_x` shader clamp to `[-1, 1]` (fixed-point hardware range).
///
/// `50` FF eye normal uses the inverse-transpose of the `WorldView` 3×3 (the
/// D3D9 normal matrix, computed inline via the cofactor form) instead of the
/// plain WV, and renormalizes only when `D3DRS_NORMALIZENORMALS` is set (new
/// `FfVsFlags::NORMALIZE_NORMALS` key bit). The per-light diffuse N·L clamps to
/// `[0, 1]`. MSL text + key bytes change for lit FF keys.
///
/// `51` `ps_1_x` `texbem`/`texbeml` applies the `D3DTTFF_PROJECTED` divide to
/// the base texcoord (`tN.xy / tN.w`) before perturbing, matching the plain
/// `tex`/`texld` path — a projected bump stage previously sampled the
/// un-divided coordinate.
///
/// `52` FF eye-normal cofactor fix: the normal matrix is built from the WV
/// columns (`vs_c[i].xyz`) instead of the transposed components
/// (`vs_c[0].x, vs_c[1].x, …`). Schema `50` fed the columns, which transposed
/// the matrix and applied the *inverse* rotation to the normal — lighting swam
/// as the camera turned. A diagonal-scale world matrix is unaffected by the
/// transpose; MSL text changes for lit FF keys with a normal.
///
/// `53` adds `VariantKey::volume_sampler_mask` (FF PS declares
/// `texture3d<float>` + samples `.xyz` for slots bound to a volume texture).
/// The `VariantKey` hash shape changes, so every PS disk key moves.
///
/// `54` D3D9 fog overhaul: programmable VS gains the
/// no-oFog specular-alpha fallback (`out.fog = float4(out.color1.w)` — VS MSL
/// changes for every non-fog-writing shader); per-pixel TABLE fog lands
/// (`VariantKey::{fog_table_mode, fog_source_w}` — hash shape changes); the
/// PS slot-13 fog binding grows from a single `&fog_color` row to the
/// two-row `*fog_data` (colour + start/end/density/depth-bias), changing the
/// MSL of every fogged PS; and the shared `Varyings` struct gains the
/// `fog_z [[center_no_perspective]]` NDC-depth field (the table-fog Z
/// source), changing the MSL of EVERY shader.
///
/// `55` adds `VariantKey::cube_sampler_mask`, which changes fixed-function
/// pixel-shader keys and emits `texturecube<float>` bindings with `.xyz`
/// coordinates.
///
/// `56` adds the `pos_fixup.z`-selected depth clamp to the FF XYZRHW vertex
/// epilogue (the D3D9 depth-clamp rule, previously `MTLDepthClipMode::Clamp`
/// on the encoder), changing the MSL of every FF RHW vertex shader.
///
/// `57` adds `VariantKey::color_out_mask` (multiple render targets): the
/// programmable PS declares `oC0..oC3` locals and returns a `PsOut` struct
/// with one `[[color(i)]]` member per exported target, changing the key hash
/// of every pixel shader and the MSL of any that writes `oC1` or above.
///
/// `59` derives the lit FF vertex shader's normal matrix from the full 4x4
/// inverse of the world-view matrix (a projective fourth column changes the
/// normal), changing the MSL of every lit FF vertex shader with a normal.
///
/// `60` point size and point sprites: every vertex shader declares the
/// per-draw `VsDraw` uniform and clamps `[[point_size]]` from it (the FF VS
/// also reads a PSIZE attribute and applies `D3DRS_POINTSCALE*`), and
/// `VariantFlags::POINT_SPRITE` makes a pixel shader take `[[point_coord]]`,
/// changing the MSL of every vertex shader and the PS key hash shape.
///
/// `61` user clip planes: `VsDraw` grows the inverse view and six planes, the
/// vertex shaders emit `[[clip_distance]]` lanes keyed on the enabled-plane
/// count (a new `FfVsKey` field and a new programmable-VS disk-key input),
/// changing every vertex shader's MSL and both VS key hash shapes.
///
/// `62` vertex texture fetch: a `vs_3_0` shader declaring samplers gains
/// `[[texture(n)]]` / `[[sampler(n)]]` vertex-function arguments read via
/// `texldl`, changing the MSL of every such vertex shader.
///
/// `63` point size converts to render pixels: the vertex epilogue multiplies
/// the `POINTSIZE_MIN/MAX`-clamped size by `pos_fixup.w` (render pixels per
/// logical pixel) and the fixed-function attenuation divides the same lane
/// back out of the viewport height, changing the MSL of every vertex shader.
///
/// `64` sampler LOD bias: `VariantFlags::LOD_BIAS` gives a pixel shader a
/// per-slot bias uniform and puts `bias(...)` on every implicit-LOD sample,
/// changing the MSL of both pixel-shader emitters and the PS key hash shape.
///
/// `65` `D3DRS_MULTISAMPLEMASK`: a pixel shader drawing into a maskable
/// multisampled render target under a narrowed mask returns a struct with a
/// `[[sample_mask]]` member, which is a new PS variant bit and new MSL for
/// both the fixed-function and the programmable emitter.
///
/// `66` types a programmable pixel shader's sampler slots from the texture
/// bound to each slot (`VariantKey::{volume_sampler_mask, cube_sampler_mask}`)
/// instead of from its `dcl_<dim>`, so the `[[texture(n)]]` argument type and
/// the coordinate swizzle of any shader whose declaration disagrees with the
/// binding change.
///
/// `67` does the same for the four vertex texture fetch slots: a `vs_3_0` slot
/// bound to a volume or cube texture emits `texture3d<float>` /
/// `texturecube<float>` and a `.xyz` coordinate whatever its `dcl_<dim>` said,
/// which is new MSL and a new programmable-VS disk-key input.
///
/// `68` preserves the `texldb` instruction control and adds the coordinate's
/// `.w` to any sampler-state bias in the emitted programmable pixel shader.
///
/// `69` lets predicate-based flow control read `p0` through the ordinary
/// source path and emits `breakp` from that source, changing programmable MSL.
///
/// `70` preserves each arithmetic destination component whose corresponding
/// SM3 predicate component is false, changing programmable shader MSL.
///
/// `71` gives `vs_1_1` `expp` its four distinct result components instead of
/// broadcasting `exp2(src)` into every lane, changing MSL for those shaders.
///
/// `72` applies sampler operand swizzles to programmable texture sample results,
/// changing the MSL of every shader that uses a non-identity sampler swizzle.
///
/// `73` applies componentwise predicate selection to `mova` writes of the
/// integer address register, changing programmable vertex shader MSL.
///
/// `74` keys native alpha-to-coverage in the pipeline flags and suppresses
/// fragment alpha testing while that coverage state is active.
///
/// `75` adds Fetch4 gather, alpha-channel and raw DF depth-channel masks.
///
/// `76` adds the canonical fixed-function vertex range-fog flag.
///
/// `77` adds the fixed-function TEMP register and packed result destination.
///
/// `78` turns `pos_fixup` into the `PosFixup` struct and adds the
/// `D3DRS_DEPTHBIAS` offset to the position epilogue, changing the MSL of
/// every vertex shader.
