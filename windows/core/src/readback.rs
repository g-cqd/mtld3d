//! Destination rules for the `GetRenderTargetData` / `GetFrontBufferData` read-backs.

//! Both entry points copy a colour texture into a system-memory destination:
//! a `D3DPOOL_SYSTEMMEM` / `D3DPOOL_SCRATCH` offscreen surface, or a level of
//! a texture in either of those pools. D3D9 copies 1:1 and converts nothing,
//! so the destination has to carry the source's extent and format, and its
//! backing has to hold every row the copy writes. The surface plumbing lives in
//! `windows/d3d9`; the geometry decision is here.
