//! Free address space and the page boxes that hold it, for the address-space watch.
//!
//! The PE side walks its regions with `VirtualQuery` and feeds each one to
//! [`FreeSpace::add_region`]; the walk itself is Win32 and stays in `d3d9`,
//! the tally is here. `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` is no source for the free figure
//! under Wine: its `ullAvailVirtual` is the total minus the process working
//! set, and on macOS the working set is the resident size of the whole
//! process, the 64-bit host side included, so it falls with resident growth
//! while the 32-bit space stays free. The sum of the free regions is the space
//! an allocation can still be served from.
//!
//! [`PageBoxHolders`] splits the live page-box bytes by the holder that keeps
//! them, with what no holder claims left as `other`, so the watch's line
//! accounts for every page box rather than leaving the gap to a guess.
