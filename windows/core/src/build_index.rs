//! Keyed index of built Metal objects, failures included.
//!
//! A draw names a shader library by its source key and a render pipeline by
//! its pipeline key, and the encoder resolves that key to the handles of the
//! built object. The build can fail (the emitter rejects the program, Metal
//! rejects the MSL or the pipeline descriptor), and a failure is as much an
//! answer as a success: the same key yields the same inputs, so building it
//! again repeats the whole build for the same result. The index therefore
//! remembers both outcomes, and a draw whose key has failed is dropped on one
//! probe.
