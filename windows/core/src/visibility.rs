//! Pure logic backing `IDirect3DQuery9::OCCLUSION` queries.
//!
//! Metal exposes per-fragment visibility counting via
//! `MTLRenderPassDescriptor.visibilityResultBuffer` + per-encoder
//! `setVisibilityResultMode:offset:` state setters. D3D9 bracketing
//! (`Issue(BEGIN)` / `Issue(END)`) can straddle render-pass boundaries
//! and command-buffer submits, so each BEGIN→END span is summed across
//! a set of u64 slots at GPU completion.
//!
//! A slot array belongs to one submit, so a span that outlives the submit
//! is cut into segments: the frame boundary closes the open span at the
//! allocator's high-water mark, queues that segment, and reopens the span
//! in the continuation frame. Each segment is summed against its own
//! frame's buffer and folded into a running total the closing segment
//! publishes. A span that could not be counted at any point (the slot
//! budget ran out, or the buffer it counted into is gone) answers with the
//! permissive `u32::MAX` rather than a count that reads as full occlusion,
//! unless no draw was issued inside it at all: zero is then the exact
//! answer rather than a guess.
//!
//! Split so this module holds only logic that needs no Metal handles:
//! the slot allocator, the per-query state machine, the sum-across-span
//! function, and the retired-buffer pool. d3d9.dll owns the COM wrapper
//! and the encoder-side wiring; mtld3d-unix owns the Metal descriptor
//! binding and command dispatch.
