//! DXSO → MSL text emitter.
//!
//! Emits each stage (VS or PS) as its own MSL translation unit with a single
//! entry point (`mtld3d_vs` or `mtld3d_ps`), so a render pipeline can freely
//! mix custom-VS + FF-PS or vice versa.
//!
//! Layout conventions:
//! - Float constants live in buffer slot 15 as `float4 *vs_c` / `ps_c`.
//! - Dynamic VS integer constants (a `loop`/`rep` counter fed by
//!   `SetVertexShaderConstantI`) live in vertex buffer slot 14 as `int4 *vs_i`,
//!   declared only when the shader reads a non-`defi` integer constant.
//! - Vertex attributes are declared at `[[attribute(N)]]` where N is the
//!   D3D9 input register index (v0 → attribute 0). The pipeline's vertex
//!   descriptor must place matching data at those slots.
//! - Varyings use `position` first, then texcoord0..7, then color0..1.
//!   Texcoord-before-color ordering works around a Metal shader-compiler
//!   crash. The same struct shape is emitted by every per-stage
//!   function — VS and PS from independent libraries still link at
//!   pipeline-creation time.
