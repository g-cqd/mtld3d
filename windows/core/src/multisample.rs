//! `D3DMULTISAMPLE_TYPE` decoding and the device's answer for it.
//!
//! One home for the two questions every multisample path asks: what sample
//! count does a `(type, quality)` pair mean, and can this Metal device create
//! a texture with it. `CheckDeviceMultiSampleType`, the surface creators and
//! `CreateDevice` all route through here so a request that passes the check is
//! exactly one the create paths accept.
