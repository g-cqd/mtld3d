# Tested games

The games mtld3d has been run with, and how far each one gets. A profile
named in the table is a built-in set of options the game gets without any
configuration; [`app_profile.rs`](../windows/core/src/app_profile.rs) gives
the reason for each one.

## Reporting a game

A game that fails or renders wrongly is tracked as a
[`game-compat`](https://github.com/athei/mtld3d/labels/game-compat) issue in
the [tracker](https://github.com/athei/mtld3d/issues); reports are welcome.
Name the game, its version and whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit, the mtld3d
release and the Wine or CrossOver version, and attach the log from
`mtld3d-logs` next to the game's executable. A report of wrong rendering is
easiest to act on with a Ctrl+Shift+P capture taken at the moment it
shows
([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md#ctrlshiftp-three-frame-dump-and-gpu-capture)
says how).
