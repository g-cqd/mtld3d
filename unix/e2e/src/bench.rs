//! A/B benchmarking of two builds of the layer: run them interleaved, then judge the numbers.
//!
//! `bench-ab` runs the `#[ignore]`d benchmarks of the candidate's test binary
//! against two installs of the layer, the base and the candidate, each under
//! a Wine tree and a prefix of its own. The binary links `d3d9` by name and
//! depends on nothing of the layer's, so the one binary drives both legs and
//! the workload is the same on either side. A round of a leg is one fresh
//! process running every selected benchmark in libtest's order, the same
//! order in both legs, and the legs alternate which goes first from round
//! to round, so a machine that drifts (thermals, a background job) moves
//! both legs alike instead of charging the drift to one of them.
//!
//! When both trees carry it, the host emitter benchmark runs in rounds of
//! its own before the others, each leg its own tree's `emit_corpus`, since
//! it is host code the candidate's binary cannot stand in for; its files
//! say `meta kind host`, and `compare` checks them apart from the layer's.
//!
//! A finished A/B directory holds `<leg>/<round>/bench-<name>.metrics`, the
//! leg `base` or `cand` and the round `0..N`. `bench-compare` reads that
//! directory back and pairs the two legs round by round, and `bench-ab` ends
//! by doing the same. A run of one clean commit against itself also leaves
//! a `same-image-allowed` file there (see `compare::check_builds`), so a later
//! `bench-compare` judges it the way `bench-ab` did, and a `wine.txt` naming
//! the one Wine both legs ran, which the report quotes. A layout comparison
//! (`--base-runtime` and the three flags beside it) runs one commit in two
//! layouts, a Wine and a build of the PE side each, and leaves a
//! `layouts.txt` naming them; its `wine.txt` names both Wines when the
//! runtimes differ (see `compare::Layouts`). After its timed
//! rounds every benchmark whose metrics declare `shape` lines also runs once
//! per leg with the layer's pass trace on, into `<leg>/shape/<test>/`; that
//! run is not timed, and its log is what the pass-shape comparison reads
//! (see `shape`).
//!
//! `bench-shape` is the odd one out: it checks a benchmark's declared frame
//! against a frame a game dumped with Ctrl+Shift+P, by hand, to calibrate
//! a scene (see `dump`). It runs nothing and judges no build.
//!
//! Exit code 0 when nothing regressed, 1 when something did (a pass shape
//! that changed included), and 2 when the run or the analysis could not be
//! trusted: a failed benchmark, a build that is not the one the leg
//! expected, a malformed metrics file, rounds that do not pair up.
