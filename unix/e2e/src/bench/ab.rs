//! Run the benchmarks against the two legs, interleaved, and check every run as it lands.
//!
//! A round of a leg is one process of the candidate's test binary running
//! every selected benchmark it carries, with libtest's `--ignored` on one
//! thread, under the leg's Wine loader and prefix and with `log.dir` pointed
//! at `<out>/<leg>/<round>`, where each benchmark writes its
//! `bench-<name>.metrics` and names itself in it (`meta test`). Round `r`
//! runs the base first when `r` is even and the candidate first when it is
//! odd. The benchmarks run in libtest's order, by test path, the same in
//! both legs and every round, so what one leaves in the process for the
//! next (the process-wide pipeline cache, the page-box pool, the address
//! space its memory rows sample) is the same on both sides of each pair;
//! each still creates its own device, whose first perf window opens with
//! it, and warms up and aligns its span as it does alone. After the last
//! round, each benchmark whose metrics declare `shape` lines
//! runs once more in either leg with the pass trace on, into
//! `<out>/<leg>/shape/<test>`; that run is never timed (the trace costs
//! frame time), and its layer log is the pass shape `compare` diffs between
//! the legs. It is stopped once the log holds enough steady submissions
//! (`shape::Watch`), so it writes no metrics: its build is checked from the
//! log's identity lines instead, against the leg's stamp and the images the
//! leg's timed rounds loaded. A benchmark without `shape` lines gets no
//! shape run, with a note: its frame is not meant to be steady. A
//! benchmark that fails or writes no metrics file, or a process whose files
//! report a layer stamp other than its leg's, ends the whole A/B run at
//! once, naming the benchmark: every number after it would be measured
//! against the wrong build or none.
//!
//! The host emitter benchmark, when the run has one, runs the first
//! benchmark processes, in rounds of its own before the end-to-end
//! benchmarks (only the short Wine process that lists them comes before),
//! so that no benchmark's Wine process is still exiting while it times host
//! code, and without a shape run. It is host code, so each leg runs its own
//! tree's `emit_corpus`, built with that leg's profile, with `--metrics`
//! pointed at the same round directory, and the run is checked the same
//! way.
