//! Check a benchmark's declared frame against a frame a game dumped, to calibrate the scene.
//!
//! Ctrl+Shift+P in a game makes the layer log a few consecutive frames
//! draw by draw (`[dump]` lines at info level: the frame's start and end,
//! every bind, clear and copy, and one line per draw naming its render
//! target, depth surface, shaders and textures). A benchmark that stands
//! for that game writes the frame it builds as `shape` lines in its metrics
//! file, one per pass. `bench-shape` reads the last complete dumped frame,
//! splits it into passes along the main lines of the layer's own splits,
//! and prints the two side by side.
//!
//! The splits modelled: a draw whose render target 0 or depth surface
//! differs from the draw before it, and the first draw after a
//! `StretchRect` or a `ColorFill`, both of which end the layer's pass. A
//! target set and set back with no draw in between opens no pass, which is
//! what the layer's join of two passes on the same attachments leaves. The
//! splits not modelled, since the dump does not show them or shows them
//! only indirectly: a clear inside a pass that the layer cannot draw as a
//! quad, an sRGB-write toggle, render targets 1 to 3 changing, a query or
//! readback that flushes the frame, texture-upload passes, and the cases
//! where the join keeps two passes apart. Clears with no draw after them are
//! left out, as the layer folds them into the next pass's load action or
//! drops them. The pass list is a calibration aid, not the layer's pass list.
//!
//! The game's passes and the benchmark's are paired in order, each pair of
//! one kind (drawing to a target of the back buffer's size, or offscreen)
//! and as close in size relative to its back buffer as the order allows, so
//! a pass one side lacks leaves one unpaired row rather than shifting every
//! row after it. Per pair the check compares the draw count (within 10 %),
//! the share of draws with a fixed-function vertex or pixel stage (within
//! 10 points) and the textures bound per draw (within 1.0); an unpaired
//! pass is flagged too. Render-target sizes are printed as ratios to each
//! side's back buffer, since a game's window and a benchmark's differ, and
//! are not judged.
//!
//! Each pair is also compared on its state mix (see [`StateMix`] for the
//! definitions): the shares of draws that blend, alpha-test, leave depth
//! writes off, cull nothing or write no colour to render target 0 (within
//! 10 points), and how often the shaders, the stage-0 texture, the blend
//! and alpha-test states and the cull mode switch from draw to draw and how
//! many distinct shaders and textures the pass uses (within 15 %, and never
//! closer than 5). A `shape` line without those keys, which older metrics
//! files and scenes that do not declare them write, still parses: its
//! state mix is printed as not reported and not judged. Exit code 0 when
//! everything judged is within tolerance, 1 otherwise.
