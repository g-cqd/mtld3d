//! Judge a finished A/B directory: pair the legs round by round and give every metric a verdict.
//!
//! Round `i` of the base and round `i` of the candidate ran back to back, so
//! each pair saw the same machine state and the comparison is made pair by
//! pair, never between the two legs' pooled numbers. Every rule turns a
//! metric's pairs into a value where more is worse whichever way the metric
//! is better, so one threshold serves both directions:
//!
//! - `time` and `noisy`: the ratio `cand / base` per pair. A regression is a
//!   median ratio above `1 + max(T, 3 sigma)`, sigma being 1.4826 times the
//!   MAD of the finite ratios, with at least 80 % of the pairs worse. `T` is
//!   8 % for a tail percentile (a name with `p99`), which moves more between
//!   runs, and 3 % otherwise. An improvement is the mirror image. A `time`
//!   metric's median difference must also exceed five steps of the
//!   resolution its value is printed with ([`time_step`]), since a value of
//!   a few steps moves by tens of percent when it crosses one. A metric
//!   whose base median is zero has no ratio and is judged by its median
//!   difference against a small absolute floor instead.
//! - `bytes`: the same with `T` at 3 % whatever the name, and the median
//!   difference must also exceed 4 MiB, since a few percent of a small
//!   footprint is allocator noise.
//! - `spikes`: the difference per pair. A regression is a median difference
//!   above `max(2, 3 MAD)`.
//! - `exact`: any pair that differs is a change, worse or better, and a
//!   change fails the comparison unless it is accepted by name, because the
//!   workload fixes these numbers and a change means the layer does
//!   different work.
//! - `info`: reported, never judged.
//!
//! Both legs run the candidate's benchmark binary, so a metric only the base
//! has was made to vanish by the candidate's layer: it fails the comparison
//! like an exact change unless it is accepted by name. One only the
//! candidate has (the `perf.*` metrics against a base without the `perf-kv`
//! line) is listed as added. A metric some rounds of a leg carry and others
//! do not is an error, except the three the `perf-kv` line may leave out of
//! a window ([`OPTIONAL_METRICS`]: the fault counts without a fault sample,
//! the pool's GPU copies without any): with one window a round those come
//! and go, and are reported as incomplete with a note, never judged. When
//! the legs measured perf windows of different lengths (`meta window_s`, a
//! base older than the 2 s interval), the rows whose value grows with the
//! span, tail percentiles, worst values and spike counts, are reported, not
//! judged, with a note.
//!
//! Rounds whose process started on a busy machine (see `machine`) are
//! listed as warnings above the notes; a warning never changes a verdict.
//!
//! Beside the numbers, each scene benchmark's untimed shape runs are
//! compared: the passes of its steady submission and every load/store
//! decision on them must be the same in both legs, and a difference fails
//! the comparison like an exact metric does unless `shape` or
//! `shape:<bench>` is accepted (see `shape`).
//!
//! Before any of that the directory has to be trustworthy: both legs hold
//! the same rounds, every benchmark wrote a file in every round of its leg,
//! the metrics keep their definitions, each leg ran one build of each kind
//! of benchmark binary throughout ([`Kind`]),
//! the two legs ran two different `d3d9.dll` images, and both ran the same
//! profile. Anything else is an error, exit code 2, not a verdict. A layout
//! comparison ([`Layouts`]) is the exception to the images rule: its legs run
//! one commit, so a binary the two layouts share is one image in both.
