//! How busy the machine was before each benchmark process, kept beside its round and flagged.
//!
//! Nothing else may run while `bench-ab` measures, and nothing enforced it:
//! a game played during a run moved the numbers with no trace in the
//! report. So before every round process the runner records the 1-minute
//! load average and measures, over [`INTERVAL`], the CPU `kernel_task` takes
//! (which rises when macOS holds the CPUs back for heat) and the CPU of the
//! processes that are not the run's own, and keeps them in the round's
//! directory, one file per process ([`file_name`]: `machine-<binary>.txt`
//! before a test binary's benchmarks, `machine-host.txt` before the host
//! emitter). The report then warns about each round that started on a busy
//! machine; a warning never changes a verdict, and such rounds are for
//! running again.
//!
//! A file holds a `load1 <x>` line, a `kernel_task <cpu%>` line, a `foreign
//! <cpu%>` line (every foreign process together) and up to [`TOP`] `top
//! <cpu%> <pid> <command line>` lines, CPU in percent of one core. A round
//! is busy when one foreign process held [`HEAVY_CPU`] %, the foreign
//! processes together [`FOREIGN_CPU`] %, or `kernel_task`
//! [`KERNEL_TASK_CPU`] %. The load average is recorded and never warned on:
//! it lags a minute behind, so it still holds the run's own builds and the
//! round before.
