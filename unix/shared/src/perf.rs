//! Cross-linkage-unit perf-tracking primitives.
//!
//! Houses the runtime gate (`PERF_TRACKING_ENABLED` cached from
//! `RUST_LOG=mtld3d::perf=info`) and the state-agnostic RAII timers
//! (`CycleSetTimer`, `CycleAddTimer`, `AtomicCycleAddTimer` for a bucket
//! several threads add to, and `NanosSetTimer` for a duration
//! that crosses the boundary), all used by `d3d9.dll` PE-side
//! AND `mtld3d.so` unix-side. Each cdylib that links `mtld3d-shared`
//! statically gets its own static instance, which matches each cdylib's
//! own `env_logger` filter cache.
//!
//! State-dependent perf (e.g. `ApiTimer` which buckets cycles into
//! `ApiPerfState`, the per-frame summary aggregator `PerfWindow`, the
//! `Summary` renderer) lives in `mtld3d-core::perf` because it's tied
//! to PE-side D3D9 state and has no unix-side analog.
//!
//! ## Compile-time gate
//!
//! Under `cfg(not(perf_tracking))` (i.e. `make` without `PERF=1`), the
//! gate helpers become `const fn` returning `false`, the timer structs
//! become zero-sized with `const fn` no-op constructors and an empty `Drop`,
//! and the statics + the latch fn vanish. LLVM then dead-code-eliminates
//! every `let _t = CycleSetTimer::start(...)` call site to literal zero
//! bytes after thin-LTO inlining.
