//! Metal wire values shared between the Windows PE side and the macOS Unix side.
//!
//! The PE side is `d3d9.dll` and `mtld3d.dll`; the Unix side is `mtld3d.so`.
//!
//! Every integer that crosses the PE/Unix boundary with symbolic meaning
//! lives here as a typed `#[repr(u32)]` enum or `bitflags!` struct — never a
//! magic literal at a call site, never a per-side `const` restatement.
//!
//! Discriminant values match the corresponding `objc2_metal` enum
//! wherever a native Metal counterpart exists.
//!
//! ## Soundness
//!
//! The `#[repr(u32)]` enums below appear as fields of `#[repr(C, align(8))]`
//! thunk param structs. Reading an enum field whose bit pattern is not a
//! declared variant is undefined behavior. The mtld3d build model makes this
//! sound: `d3d9.dll`, `mtld3d.dll`, and `mtld3d.so` are rebuilt atomically by
//! `make` and installed together by `make install`, so every side sees the
//! same `mtl` definitions. Any wire-format change (new variant, new
//! discriminant) is a coupled edit across both sides in the same commit.
//!
//! When a thunk param carries a polymorphic `u32` whose interpretation
//! depends on another field (e.g. `Command::param_a`, whose meaning depends
//! on `Command::cmd`), typed decoding uses `Enum::from_repr(raw) ->
//! Option<Self>` from `strum::FromRepr`. Never cast, never transmute.
