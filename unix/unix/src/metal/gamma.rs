//! The gamma ramp a layer's present pass applies.
//!
//! D3D9's gamma ramp is the display's transfer function, so nothing upstream
//! of the drawable may carry it: the game's back buffer, every render target
//! and every readback stay exactly as the game drew them. The only place it
//! belongs is the present pass, as a table its fragment stage looks each
//! channel up in.
//!
//! The table is 256 entries of four `u16` lanes, which the PE side has already
//! validated and laid out ([`mtld3d_core::gamma`]); this module only keeps it
//! for the layer it belongs to and hands it to an encoder. At 2 KiB it fits
//! `setFragmentBytes:`, which copies it into the command buffer, so a layer
//! needs no Metal resource of its own and nothing has to outlive a present.
//!
//! One writer and one reader, both the encoder thread: the ramp arrives on the
//! frame the guest's `SetGammaRamp` rode out on, ahead of that frame's own
//! present. The mutex is what makes the map safely shared with the teardown
//! path, and it is taken per present only while a ramp is active.
