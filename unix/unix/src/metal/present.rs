//! Present-time render pass: the game's back buffer onto the drawable.
//!
//! Every present that is not a 1:1 copy of a `BGRA8` back buffer onto a
//! `BGRA8` drawable comes through here. One fullscreen triangle, three
//! fragment entry points, one for each thing present has to do:
//!
//! - **SDR at any ratio**: sample and write. Exact at matching extents, a
//!   filtered stretch otherwise. This is the route that guarantees every
//!   drawable pixel is written whatever the geometry, which
//!   `MTLBlitCommandEncoder` cannot do (it only copies 1:1) and
//!   `MTLFXSpatialScaler` cannot do either (it only enlarges).
//! - **HDR without headroom**: sRGB → linear, no tone mapping.
//! - **HDR with headroom**: sRGB → linear plus SDR→HDR inverse tone
//!   mapping in **`ICtCp`** (BT.2100 perceptual color space).
//!
//! The HDR pair exists because when the `CAMetalLayer` is configured for
//! EDR (`RGBA16Float` + `kCGColorSpaceExtendedLinear*` +
//! `wantsExtendedDynamicRange = true`) the drawable expects linear float
//! values, not the gamma-encoded bytes the game wrote.
//!
//! The `ICtCp` variant of BT.2446 Method A operates on the I (intensity)
//! channel of `ICtCp` while leaving Ct/Cp (chroma) untouched, so
//! saturated content (spells, fire, sunset) keeps its chroma when
//! lifted into HDR brightness instead of desaturating toward white.
//!
//! Output values are in linear BT.709/sRGB primaries — the same
//! primaries the source backbuffer uses. The display-class-matched
//! layer colorspace (`ExtendedLinearSRGB` / `ExtendedLinearDisplayP3` /
//! `ExtendedLinearITUR_2020`, picked at attach time in
//! `macdrv::configure_metal_layer_inner`) tells macOS what primaries
//! those values are in; macOS gamut-converts to the panel as needed.
//!
//! The library + pipeline states are created once per process on the
//! first shader-driven present (via `OnceLock`) and reused. Resources
//! intentionally leak on shutdown — they're process-lifetime objects
//! alongside the device and command queue.

///   `ICtCp` rather than on luminance alone. Output is in linear BT.709
///   primaries; `1.0` = SDR-paper-white = 100 nits, values exceed 1.0
///   for HDR.
///
/// Vertex stage: synthesise a single oversized triangle covering the

///
/// `L_SDR` is pinned to `100.0` because Apple's compositor anchors

/// `maximumPotentialExtendedDynamicRangeColorComponentValue` as a

/// `P_SDR` is the constant `pSDR` from ITU-R BT.2446 §6.1.1 at
