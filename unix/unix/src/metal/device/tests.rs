//! Unit tests for the process-pinned Metal device.
//!
//! The pin is what makes the process-wide Metal caches sound: they hold
//! pipeline states, textures and buffers built on one `MTLDevice`, and Metal
//! rejects an encode that mixes objects of two. Every Mac these tests run on
//! has one GPU, so the assertions pin the invariant rather than reproduce the
//! dual-GPU divergence, which needs graphics switching to observe.
