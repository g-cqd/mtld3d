//! Per-queue presentation: packets, snapshot slots, and the thread that presents them.
//!
//! A frame's render command buffer commits without a drawable. What it
//! leaves for presentation is a [`PresentPacket`]: the layer, the texture the
//! present reads, and the frame's sequence. One native thread per queue takes
//! the packets in order, acquires the drawable, encodes the present route into
//! a command buffer of its own and commits it. A read-back that flushes the
//! frame in progress therefore waits for committed render work and the GPU,
//! never for the display.
//!
//! The one hazard the split creates is a later render overwriting the back
//! buffer before a pending present has read it. A present-bearing submit
//! waits for the previous present to commit, which is the cadence the display
//! set before the split and costs nothing. A submit that must not wait, a
//! no-present partial frame or one a barrier hurries, copies the pending
//! present's source into a slot and retargets the packet at it, so the frame
//! it shows is the one it was given. At most one pending packet reads the back
//! buffer; every later one reads a slot. A slot is reused once the present
//! that read it has committed: the next copy into it is a later buffer on the
//! same queue, and Metal executes a queue's buffers in commit order.
//!
//! Lock order, top to bottom: a state's `inner`, held across the encode and
//! commit of one present
//! or snapshot buffer and never across `nextDrawable`, `waitUntilCompleted`,
//! the gate or a synchronous main-thread hop; then the upscale caches, the
//! in-flight command buffer registry, the attachment registry and its
//! per-record streak, the cursor overlay's shared state, in that order, each
//! held for a lookup or one encode and taking nothing below it. A present's
//! completion handler takes the in-flight registry alone. The only blocking
//! under `inner` is a wait on one of the state's own condition variables.
