//! One D3D device's unix-side record: the queue it renders on and its presentation state.
//!
//! `CreateCommandQueue` builds the record, hands the PE side a
//! [`DeviceRecordHandle`] for it, and every later thunk that acts on that
//! device names it with that handle. `DestroyCommandQueue` gives the handle
//! back, which retires the presenter thread and drops the record, releasing
//! the queue with it. Nothing indexes a device by address: what the caller
//! holds is the record.
//!
//! The record is shared: the API thread creates and destroys it, the submit
//! thread pushes frames onto it, its own presenter thread consumes them, and
//! Metal's completion and presented handlers touch what they captured. An
//! `Arc` counts those references, and the presenter's own `Arc` is what
//! keeps the record alive between the handle's release and the thread's
//! last instruction.
