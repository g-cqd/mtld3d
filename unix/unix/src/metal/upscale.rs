//! `MetalFX` spatial upscale of the back buffer on the way to the drawable.
//!
//! The back buffer and the drawable are no longer the same size: the drawable
//! covers the window, while the back buffer is the grid we rasterize on. When
//! the two differ, present has to resample, and `MTLBlitCommandEncoder` only
//! does 1:1 copies.
//!
//! `MTLFXSpatialScaler` is the good path for that resample. It is an
//! edge-aware upscaler rather than a stretched bilinear sample, so a
//! half-resolution frame comes back materially sharper than the compositor's
//! own scaling would give. Compatible drawables are written directly; other
//! destinations receive a copy from a Private output.
//!
//! In SDR the scaler runs on the game's `BGRA8Unorm` back buffer in
//! `Perceptual` colour-processing mode, which is what an sRGB-encoded 8-bit
//! surface wants. In HDR the present shader tone-maps first, at render
//! resolution, and the scaler runs on that `RGBA16Float` result in `HDR` mode —
//! the mode built for values beyond `[0, 1]`.
//!
//! Two cases it does not serve. **A drawable smaller than the back buffer**:
//! the spatial scaler only enlarges, which is why `render.scale` is capped at
//! `1.0`. And **a GPU without `MetalFX`**: [`is_supported`] answers that once
//! at layer attach, and the PE side then holds `render.scale` at `1.0` so the
//! scaler is not the only thing standing between a scaled frame and the
//! screen. Both fall to the present shader's filtered stretch
//! (`PresentPipelines::copy`), which covers any ratio; this module is the
//! quality path, not the correctness one.
//!
//! Scalers and scratch targets live in an [`UpscaleCache`] on the device's
//! own record, keyed by (input size, output size, format, colour mode). They
//! are per device because the input and output textures are properties set on
//! the scaler and read by the encode that follows them, so one object shared
//! by two devices presenting at one window size would let each write the
//! other's frame through it.
//!
//! Unlike the pipelines in `blit.rs` / `clear_quad.rs` / `present.rs`, they are
//! **not** leaked for the process: a resize walks through a new key per size
//! the window rests at, and each one holds ~16 MiB of intermediates. Both
//! caches are bounded ([`MAX_CACHED_SCALERS`], [`MAX_CACHED_SCRATCH`]) and
//! evict their least-recently-used entry, with the release deferred to a
//! command buffer of the device's queue; everything a device holds, live and
//! evicted, is released in `DestroyCommandQueue`.
