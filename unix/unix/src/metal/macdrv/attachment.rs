//! One attachment record per device: the display state a metal view owns.
//!
//! `AttachMetalLayer` creates a metal view and its `CAMetalLayer` for one
//! device's window and registers an [`Attachment`] for them here, keyed by
//! the view's address, which is the handle every later thunk of that device
//! already carries (`SubmitFrame`, `DestroyCommandQueue`, `SetCursorOverlay`).
//! Everything the display decides for that window lives on the record:
//! whether the layer carries the HDR configuration, the live EDR headroom,
//! the present throttle, the window's occlusion, the backing scale published
//! to the PE side and the present-geometry streak. Several devices attached
//! at once each own their record, and one device's teardown touches only its
//! own.
//!
//! Liveness. A record is live exactly while it is in [`ATTACHMENTS`]. The
//! `view` and `layer` addresses and the two PE-side sink addresses a record
//! holds are valid only while it is live: `DestroyCommandQueue` unregisters
//! the record before it releases the view, and the PE side drops the box
//! behind the sinks after that thunk returns. So every dereference of one of
//! those addresses happens inside a helper in this file that holds the
//! registry lock and checks the record is still the one the map holds for
//! its view (`Arc::ptr_eq`, not key equality, so a view address the
//! allocator hands out again names a new record rather than resurrecting an
//! old one). Outside those helpers a record is plain data: atomics and
//! immutable words a main-thread observer, the submit thread and the API
//! thread may read at any time, whether or not the record is still live.
//!
//! The lock is held for a lookup plus one retain or one atomic store, never
//! across `AppKit` work, and nothing in this file takes any other lock, so
//! the registry lock sits at the bottom of every order. It is not taken
//! anywhere else.
