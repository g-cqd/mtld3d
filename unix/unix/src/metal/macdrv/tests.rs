//! Unit tests for the present-throttle duration and the layer-mode decision.
//!
//! `min_present_duration` folds the guest's vsync request and the user's
//! `present.maxFps` ceiling into the minimum seconds handed to
//! `presentDrawable:afterMinimumDuration:`. Bit-exact assertions pin every
//! combination of the two inputs: the lower of the two rates wins, an
//! unknown panel rate still honours the user cap, and only IMMEDIATE with
//! no cap resolves to `0.0` for an unthrottled free run.
//!
//! `layer_mode_for` and `layer_mode_change` decide which `CAMetalLayer`
//! configuration a screen asks for and whether the applied one has to be
//! replaced. `min_present_duration_change` and `backing_scale_change` are
//! their two neighbours in the same reconciliation. All four are the whole of
//! the display-follow decision, so the tests below pin both directions of a
//! display change, the user's off switch, the degenerate ceilings, and the
//! case that must *not* reconfigure. A Reset that flips the guest's
//! `PresentationInterval` reaches the throttle through the same
//! reconciliation with the panel unchanged, so both directions of that flip
//! and the user cap that holds through it are pinned there too.
//!
//! `screen_params_filter_step` decides what one attempt to take
//! `NSApplicationDidChangeScreenParametersNotification` over from Wine does.
//! The tests pin all three outcomes, and in particular that an attempt made
//! before `NSApp` has a delegate resolves to a retry rather than to a filter
//! marked installed, which is what keeps a process whose first `CreateDevice`
//! beats Wine's application delegate from running unfiltered for its lifetime.
//!
//! `MetalViewPark` is the bookkeeping behind keeping a retired device's metal
//! view for the next device on its window, or for the next window when that
//! one is gone. The tests pin that a window's view is kept and taken back by
//! that window alone, that a second view for the same window displaces the
//! first, that views of several windows are kept beside each other up to the
//! park's size, that a full park displaces its oldest view, that the kept
//! views are listed newest first and one is taken only by the parking its
//! taker saw, and that among them the newest whose window is gone is the one
//! picked for a window with none of its own.
//!
//! The other half of that path, what a device's teardown retires and what
//! it leaves alone for the devices still attached, is the attachment
//! registry's, and lives in `attachment/tests.rs`.
//!
//! `MacdrvFuncs::load` is pinned for the one case a test process can
//! produce: no `macdrv_functions` table in the symbol space, which is every
//! process that is not Wine's. The table is the only door, so the load
//! resolves nothing and the attach above it fails rather than reading a
//! window record through a layout the process does not have.
//!
//! What that load does with a table it did get is pinned on tables built
//! here: `first_null_required_entry` names the first entry the layer calls
//! that a table leaves null, which is what turns a null entry into a warn
//! and a clean failure instead of a transmuted null called as a function,
//! and it passes a table whose only null is `macdrv_get_cocoa_window`,
//! which the layer treats as optional. The layout the table is read
//! through is pinned beside them, field offset by field offset, since
//! nothing at run time compares it against the fork's.
//!
//! The record that table's `get_win_data` answers with is pinned the same
//! way. The layer declares the four pointers it reads out of the fork's
//! `struct d3dmetal_macdrv_win_data` and takes the client view out of the
//! fourth, so those four offsets are asserted here beside the table's.
//!
//! `run_through_wine` is the synchronous main-thread hop through that
//! table's `on_main_thread`. A test process has no Wine main thread, so the
//! entry is stood in for by one that does what Wine's does with the block:
//! copies it, runs it once, and lets the copy go. The test pins that the work
//! has run exactly once by the time the hop returns. Two more stand-ins are
//! stubs: one drops the block, as `CrossOver`'s arm64 build does, and one keeps
//! a copy and runs it after the hop has returned; the hop answers that the
//! work did not run, and the late run leaves the work alone.
