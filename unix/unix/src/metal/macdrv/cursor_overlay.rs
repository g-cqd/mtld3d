//! The software cursor: the game's cursor bitmap drawn in a transparent overlay window.
//!
//! The PE side keeps the Win32 cursor blank while `cursor.software` is on and
//! sends the cursor's sprite and visibility through the `SetCursorOverlay`
//! thunk; this module draws that sprite in a borderless, click-through
//! `NSWindow` one level above the game window. The hardware cursor plane is
//! never toggled, and under HDR the sprite goes through the same tone map as
//! the frame, so the cursor is as bright as the UI it hovers over.
//!
//! The window never moves with the pointer: it has the game window's frame
//! and moves with it as a child, and the sprite is an image layer moved inside
//! it, clipped at the game window's edges. A window frame change makes
//! `AppKit` re-resolve the cursor for the pointer's location, and with no
//! cursor of our own to offer it lands on the arrow over the game's blank
//! cursor on every mouse move; a layer moving inside a fixed window is
//! invisible to that machinery. Show and hide swap the layer's
//! pixels, a sprite or a transparent image, so its surface stays in the
//! window's scene: taking a surface out from above the game layer is free,
//! putting one back costs the game's next present a refresh, and a game
//! hiding the cursor while a button is held would pay that on every click.
//!
//! Threads. The thunk runs on the API thread and only writes [`SHARED`] and
//! queues one main-thread wakeup, coalesced through [`APPLY_PENDING`]. The
//! pre-commit run-loop observer reconciles the latest state once per
//! transaction, and only when the pointer moved or an apply was requested
//! ([`RECONCILE_REQUESTED`]): the thunk, a detach, a GPU completion, a present,
//! an activation change and a headroom refresh each request one, so an
//! iteration of Wine's busy main loop that changed nothing costs one pointer
//! read. Everything that touches `AppKit`, Core Animation or the overlay's
//! Metal objects runs on the main thread: the observer, the activation
//! notifications and the reconciliation of position, visibility, layer mode
//! and EDR headroom. Those objects live in a main-thread `thread_local`, which
//! makes the split sound without a lock around `Retained` handles.
//!
//! Nothing about the game window is latched: the game `NSWindow` and its
//! frame are read at every apply, its level and client rectangle when the
//! sprite can be shown, from the view of the attachment record the overlay
//! follows, so in-game resolution changes, windowed/fullscreen switches and
//! display moves need no signal from the PE side. There is one system cursor
//! and one overlay window for the process, and they follow the device whose
//! `SetCursorOverlay` arrived most recently (under [`SHARED`]):
//! `SetCursorProperties` and `ShowCursor` are per-device calls, so the device
//! that last spoke is the device the game means.
//!
//! The sprite's position and its pixels reach the compositor together. The
//! completed image is assigned in the Core Animation transaction, so a hide
//! and the move made with it land in one frame and the old sprite is never
//! seen at a new place. The observer reads the pointer's position at every
//! pass, so a warp the game makes through winemac, which runs on this thread
//! and delivers no event, is followed in the same transaction as the hide or
//! show beside it. While a changed sprite renders, the sprite already on
//! screen keeps following the pointer with its own geometry.
//!
//! Another process can take the pointer without telling this one: the
//! interactive screenshot crosshair. Its window is what a click at the pointer
//! would hit, so the hit test that decides whether the pointer is over the
//! game answers that window, the sprite hides, and the native cursor is left
//! to the tool. When the hit test answers the game window again, the PE side
//! is asked for its null-then-set kick, which makes Wine re-apply the cursor
//! the tool replaced. A window of this process over the game (a dialog) hides
//! the sprite the same way but needs no kick: Wine re-applies its cursor when
//! the pointer re-enters the game window. The kick serves the hardware cursor
//! too, so the observer is installed at attach for every device, overlay or
//! not.
