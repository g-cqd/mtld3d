//! The metal layer's own `nextDrawable`, and the Wine client surface it would have presented.
//!
//! The layer Wine creates for a metal view is a `WineMetalLayer`, winemac's
//! `CAMetalLayer` subclass whose only change is a `nextDrawable` override:
//! before it acquires the drawable it reads `superview` and `window` of the
//! view the layer backs and, when the view sits in a client surface's cocoa
//! view, posts that surface's present to the window's event queue, which
//! makes Wine show that cocoa view and hide the window's other one. The
//! presenter calls `nextDrawable` on its own thread, so every present into a
//! visible window made that override walk `AppKit` off the main thread.
//!
//! So attach turns the layer back into the plain `CAMetalLayer` it extends
//! ([`bypass_present_hook`]), and the one thing the override did for the
//! layer is done here instead, on the thread that asks: the client surface
//! the view sits in is read on the main thread ([`client_surface_of`]),
//! retained, and presented through win32u's own `client_surface_present`
//! when a device attaches to it and when a device leaves a window another
//! live device still presents into. Wine showed the surface of whichever
//! device presented last; this shows the surface of the newest device
//! attached to the window.
//!
//! The surface functions are win32u's exports, called on the API thread,
//! which is a Wine thread: `client_surface_present` takes win32u's surface
//! lock and then the Mac driver's window data, the order every other caller
//! of it takes them in.
