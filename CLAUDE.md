# Working on mtld3d

[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) is the operating manual for this repository:
the gates, how to read their output, how conformance work is organised, and what
a pull request is expected to contain. Read it before changing anything.

It points at the files that own the rules:

- [`README.md`](README.md), the goal, the features, the requirements, and how
  to install, configure and log.
- [`docs/BUILDING.md`](docs/BUILDING.md), building from source, the gates and
  tests, the arm64 Wine switches and their paths, benchmarks and the release
  bundle.
- [`docs/GAMES.md`](docs/GAMES.md), the games tested so far and how far each
  one gets.
- [`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md), what is implemented, what is not, and
  the divergences kept on purpose.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), the workflow and the lessons that no
  other file owns.
- [`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`](docs/CONVENTIONS.md), every code rule, with
  `make audit` enforcing the mechanical half. State lives on an object, not in
  a static: a new `static` holding mutable state needs one of the arguments
  that section lists, written in its doc block.
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), the PE/Unix boundary contract,
  the threading model, and the diagnostic toolkits.
- [`unix/conformance/CONFORMANCE.md`](unix/conformance/CONFORMANCE.md), the
  conformance suite, the classification scheme, and the rationale behind every
  divergence we keep.
- [`windows/tests/COVERAGE.md`](windows/tests/COVERAGE.md), what the end-to-end
  suite covers and which stubs it pins.
- [`mtld3d.conf`](mtld3d.conf), every runtime option with its default.

`make check` and `make test` are the gates. `CONTRIBUTING.md` explains how to
read a test run, which matters here: the runner is fail-fast and its summary
undercounts.

Every plan and every pull request is checked against those rules before it is
presented or opened, section by section, and the check is written down. A
plan carries a "Rules check" section that names what it introduces (a static,
a config key, a wire field, a dependency, a derive, a lint suppression, a
duplicate of something that already exists) and why each is allowed; a pull
request's verification names the gates that enforce those rules and ran
green. A plan or PR without that check is not ready.
