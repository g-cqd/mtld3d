# The arm64 legs read four paths that have no default here. Each comes from
# the environment or the command line, and each target that needs one fails
# naming it when it is unset or points at the wrong thing. The first three are
# the ARM64X toolchain: the ARM64X build (`windows-arm64x` and what builds on
# it) reads all three and its clippy leg (`clippy-pe-arm64x`) the first, and
# EC=1 adds both to the default targets. WINE_ARM64 is read by the install,
# test, conformance and benchmark targets under EC=1 or ARM64=1, and always by
# `bench-variants`, so `EC=1 make` and `EC=1 make check` run without it.
# ARM64=1 reads only WINE_ARM64:
#
#   WINE_SDK_ARM64X  a tree holding Wine's two ARM64X link archives,
#                    `libwinecrt0.a` and `libntdll.a`, under
#                    `lib/wine/aarch64-windows`: what wine-build's "ARM64X link
#                    libraries" step stages as `dist/wine-arm64x`. The Wine SDK
#                    is an x86 Wine and carries neither. The ARM64X build and
#                    its clippy leg read it.
#   LLVM_MINGW       an llvm-mingw install, whose ARM64 and ARM64EC sysroots
#                    are the CRT the link takes. The ARM64X build reads it.
#   ARM64X_LLD       an `lld-link` of LLD 23 or newer, such as Homebrew's
#                    `lld`. The ARM64X build reads it.
#   WINE_ARM64       an arm64 Wine tree, the directory holding `bin/wine` and
#                    `lib/wine`, that `EC=1 make install` installs the ARM64X
#                    DLLs into and `ARM64=1 make install` the x86 ones, and
#                    whose private clones the arm64-runtime test, conformance
#                    and benchmark legs of EC=1 and ARM64=1 run under, as do
#                    the arm64 legs of `bench-variants`. ISOLATED=1 below
#                    clones it for the installs as it clones the SDK.

# Clone the directory tree $(1) to $(2), cheapest mechanism first. On one APFS
# volume clonefile(2) takes a directory and clones the whole hierarchy in a
# single call, so the cost is the call and not the file count, where `cp -c -R`
# asks for a clone per file and pays for the walk: 12 GB over 88000 files is
# under a second against eleven. No stock command line tool exposes the
# directory form, hence python3 and ctypes. A source on another volume fails
# with EXDEV and one on a volume that is not APFS cannot clone at all, which is
# what the two `cp` fallbacks are for, the second of them copying the bytes.
# Prints nothing on stdout, so `$(shell ...)` can call it.
#
# Copying a single file takes `cp -c` instead: one clonefile(2) for the one
# file, and cp itself falls back to a byte copy when the destination is on
# another volume or on a volume that cannot clone.

# Per-arch build leaves. Each PE arch and each unix arch is independent, so a
# job (or a developer) that only needs one does not pay for the others; the
# aggregates above keep the everything-at-once habit.
#
# mtld3d.dll is only ever a Wine builtin (it owns the unix-call globals), so it
# gets the builtin signature at build time. d3d9.dll stays an ordinary native PE
# here: `install` and `bundle` mark their staged copies instead, so the build
# output can also be loaded as a native override in Wine distributions we don't
# control (CrossOver).
#
# The "fake DLL" placeholder is a prefix marker for the mtld3d builtin name,
# since Wine resolves a builtin by finding a marker for that NAME in the
# prefix's system directories before it loads the real module out of lib/wine.
# `install` does not need one and does not ship one: wineboot stamps a marker
# for every builtin it finds in lib/wine when it creates a prefix, and the
# install targets run first. Only `bundle` carries it, under prefix-markers/
# rather than wine/, for the case where that ordering does not hold: an
# existing prefix, or a Wine installation we do not control.

# ARM64X `d3d9.dll` and `mtld3d.dll`, built with EC=1 only: the layout an arm64
# Wine keeps its own builtins in, one image under `lib/wine/aarch64-windows`
# holding an ARM64 half for arm64 processes and an ARM64EC half that x64
# processes run natively, where the x64 DLLs above would be emulated. 32-bit
# processes still load the i386 DLLs. Rust has no ARM64X target, so each crate
# is built once per half as a static library, and one `lld-link /machine:arm64x`
# puts both halves into one image.
#
# The CRT is llvm-mingw's, because MSVC ships its ARM64 and ARM64EC libraries
# only with Visual Studio, and xwin splats neither. `dllcrt2.o` is the DLL
# entry point, and it does what MSVC's does for the x86 DLLs: it runs the
# static initializers std registers, sets up TLS and runs the module's atexit
# table at detach. `-lldmingw` is the linker mode that CRT is written for, in
# which LLD supplies the constructor list `libmingw32.a` reads. The one symbol
# of MSVC's static CRT that remains (the `type_info` vtable), and the
# thread-exit teardown of snmalloc that MSVC's CRT runs and llvm-mingw's does
# not, are in `windows/d3d9/src/arm64_crt.rs`. `kernel32` precedes `mincore`,
# so what both define is imported from `KERNEL32.dll` as the x86 DLLs import
# it, and only what `kernel32` lacks (`WaitOnAddress`, `VirtualAlloc2FromApp`)
# comes from the API sets. `ntdll` is Wine's own import library rather than
# llvm-mingw's, the one the `unix_lib.o` inside the shim is built against, and
# it carries the ARM64EC stack probe. It goes last: LLD takes a symbol from the
# first library that defines it, and Wine's ntdll also exports C runtime
# functions (`memcpy`, `_errno`) that have to come from the ucrt the rest of
# the CRT uses. Each library is named by path for both halves, since both
# sysroots spell it the same. `/defarm64native` exports the same names from the
# ARM64 half as `/def` does from the EC half. `/opt:ref,icf` is what rustc
# passes for the x86 DLLs, and `/debug` would otherwise turn both off: it drops
# the code nothing reaches, along with any C assertion import that code
# carries.
#
# The linker has to be LLD 23 or newer. An ARM64X image has one TLS directory
# field, and each half brings its own `_tls_used`, `_tls_index` and TLS
# callbacks; LLD 23 gives the EC view its own directory through an ARM64X
# relocation, where LLD 22 hands both views the ARM64 one, so an x64 process
# runs the ARM64 TLS callbacks under the x64 emulator and its EC code reads a
# TLS index the loader never set. Homebrew's `lld` is one: its version follows
# Homebrew's `llvm`, and llvm-mingw's own LLD may be older.
#
# LLVM_MINGW is the CRT, and its `llvm-nm` reads the static libraries for the
# checks below; ARM64X_LLD is the linker; WINE_SDK_ARM64X holds the Wine
# archives (all three at the top of this file).

# (`windows/core/src/guest_mem.rs`) cannot break silently: none of them may
# compile to a call to itself or to one of the others. Under the x64 emulator
# such a call recurses until the stack overflows, and no CI leg runs the
# emulator. The x86_64 link writes a linker map (`windows/d3d9/build.rs`); the
# gate takes from it the address and size of the four exports and of every

#     runs, and the suite's processes must not race it.
#   - shader.asyncCompile=false: a draw whose build is in flight is kept in
#     its frame, whose submission waits for the build, instead of being left
#     out, so a test's first frame shows every draw it made. The builds still
#     run on the worker threads, which the waiting encoder steals from, so
#     the suite exercises them either way;
#     `async_compile.rs` turns the option on for the frames it leaves out.
#   - color.hdr.enable=false    the shipped default is on, and it resolves off
#     the running machine's panel, so leaving it would make the suite take the
#     HDR present route on an EDR Mac and the SDR one elsewhere. Pin it so the
#     results mean the same thing everywhere; the HDR route is exercised by real
#     runs and by the present-pipeline tests, not by the e2e assertions.
#   - debug.mainThreadChecker=true loads Apple's Main Thread Checker into each
#     test process, so an AppKit call off the main thread fails the run where
#     it is made (MTC_CRASH_ON_REPORT, exported above) instead of surfacing as
#     a rare death later in Wine's own code.
#   - WINEDEBUG= (empty)        — silence the +msync debug channel's per-call spam.
# MTL_DEBUG_LAYER stays on (inherited) so Metal API misuse fails the tests.
#
# SCALE=<n> additionally reruns the whole e2e suite at `render.scale = <n>`,
# i.e. rasterizing the back buffer smaller than the resolution D3D9 reports and
# letting MetalFX resolve it. Every coordinate the suite asserts on is in the
# reported space, so a passing scaled run is the evidence that the logical and
# render spaces stayed separate. `make test SCALE=0.75` is what one CI leg
# runs; try 0.5 and a non-dividing 0.67 too, since those catch rounding that a
# clean fraction hides.
#
# INTEL=1 reruns the whole e2e suite under every `intel.*` key, i.e. with the
# device answers an Intel/AMD Mac gives: packed 16-bit formats expanded, 32-bit
# float filtering denied, Managed buffers with didModifyRange after each write,
# and the 256-byte linear texture alignment. Every assertion has to hold there
# too; a test that probes a capability asks the device and asserts the answer
# it gets, which is also what lets the suite run on real Intel hardware.
#
# LOG_DIR=<absolute unix path> puts every test process's log file (and its GPU
# traces) in one directory instead of beside each test binary, so a machine
# that is only reachable through its artifacts (a CI runner) can hand the logs
# back, which every CI end-to-end leg does. The layer reads the directory on
# the PE side, where the unix root is drive Z, and the runner writes the whole
# stderr of every process that died there beside those logs and moves the
# layer's log of that process next to it, out of the layer's own retention.
# Abnormal exits after complete test reports also keep captured stdout, stderr
# and exit status together in a .process-log file, without changing verdicts.
# Ten files of each kind are kept per directory.

# The e2e suite, one leg per PE arch: each installs the arch it exercises plus
# the unix `.so` this SDK's Wine loads, so the two legs are independent jobs.
#
# The suite is seven test binaries per arch (`windows/tests/tests`: the
# one-process suite `e2e`, `d3d8` for the Direct3D 8 frontend, and `exit_code`,
# `unload`, `unload_after_device`, `snmalloc_drift` and `thread_exit`, which
# need a process of their own), and the runner in `unix/e2e` runs each once under
# Wine, every test of a binary on `JOBS` threads of that one process, each
# with its own device. Only a failure, a crash or a hang costs another
# process: the runner marks the test it attributes the end to and runs the
# rest again. So a run is fourteen Wine launches, and its report counts every
# test rather than stopping at a summary.
#
# JOBS=<n> is how many tests run at once, each on its own thread with its
# own device. A parallel run is the only thing here that keeps several devices
# alive at once, which is what a game does with a launcher or an overlay
# beside it, so it is what holds the per-device rule: what one device owns
# is keyed by that device, and a process-wide registry keyed without one
# hands two devices each other's work.
# Rendering tests use borderless windows: Wine builds a framed window's
# title bar and controls on the AppKit main thread, serializing the tests
# even when their windows stay hidden. Window-management tests explicitly
# keep framed windows so that their style and teardown paths stay covered.
#
# The default of 4 assumes a Wine built from `cx-26-patched` at or after
# the winemac change that releases the D3DMetal client surfaces outside the
# window data lock; no wine-build release up to `cx-26.3.0-3` carries it.
# Without it the two locks are taken in both orders (`macdrv_DestroyWindow`
# holds the window data and takes win32u's surface lock,
# `update_client_surfaces` and `detach_client_surfaces` the other way
# round), so a window torn down on one thread while another thread creates,
# moves or destroys its own deadlocks the process. The report is still
# right there, because the watchdog charges the hang and runs the rest one
# at a time, but the suite takes ~130 s instead of ~10 s and JOBS=1 avoids
# it outright. CI passes JOBS=1 for a reason of its own, that device
# creation cannot overlap on a paravirtual GPU, so its value says nothing
# about this default.
#
# TIMEOUT=<secs> is how long a process may go without reporting a result
# before the runner kills it and charges the hang to the test that was
# running (default 60); the same bound covers a process that has closed
# stdout but will not exit. A process tree that keeps stderr open after the
# process is gone gets a one-second grace, not the bound: nothing it says
# after that is the test's.
#
# A scaled or Intel-variant run reports the whole suite instead of stopping at
# the first failure, and FAIL_FAST=0 asks for that on any run. The point of
# `SCALE` and `INTEL` is to survey which assertions still hold in the reported
# space or under the Intel answers, and one dependent test would otherwise
# hide every later test's behaviour there. The default run keeps fail-fast:
# there the first failure is a regression to fix, not a survey to read.
#
# FILTER='<patterns>' narrows the run to the tests whose id (`<binary>::<test
# path>`, e.g. `e2e::msaa::resolve_counts_edge_pixels`) contains any of the
# whitespace-separated patterns: `msaa::` is one file, `stencil` every test
# with the word. A filter that selects nothing passes.

# The synthetic benchmarks (NOT part of `make test`), the `#[ignore]`d tests of
# `windows/tests/tests/e2e/bench_*.rs` (`windows/tests/COVERAGE.md` has a row
# for each file): frames shaped like World of Warcraft 1.12's and 3.3.5a's busy
# frames (`wow_112_busy_frame`, `wow_335a_busy_frame`), frames that each meet
# pixel shaders never seen before with the shader cache off, an EVENT-query
# throttle under the `wow` profile's query keys and under the D3D9 defaults
# (`query_poll_wow`, `query_poll_spec`), the API thread's cost of one call
# of each kind (`api_call_cost`), buffer locks and texture streaming at a
# game's rates (`dynamic_buffer_churn`, `texture_streaming`), and fresh
# processes from launch to their first frame on a populated shader cache
# (`cold_start`). They are `#[ignore]`d tests of the e2e
# binary, so the suite reports them ignored; this runs them alone, one at a
# time in one process, through the runner's `--ignored`, for one PE arch
# (ARCH, default i686, the arch the game ships). They measure and never assert
# on a time, so a run is red only when a device call fails.
#
# The layer and the benchmark binary are built with the production profile,
# the one that ships, since `release` compiles in debug assertions whose
# checks cost the encoder more than the frame does; PROD=0 measures `release`
# instead, and each report states the profile and whether debug assertions
# were on. The Metal validation layer and HUD are off: both cost frame time
# and neither is under test. The configuration is the suite's without the
# Main Thread Checker, then BENCH_CONFIG='key=value;key=value', appended last
# the way SCALE is, so its entries win over the ones before it (the stutter
# benchmark's own `shaderCache.enable=false` still wins over them). PERF=1
# builds the layer with its perf summary. Each benchmark writes
# `bench-<name>.txt` into LOG_DIR (default `.codex/evidence/bench`), beside
# the layer's log that a PERF=1 build's summary rows are copied from, and
# `bench-<name>.metrics` next to it, the same numbers plus the build's
# identity, its address-space samples, a scene's per-pass shape and, from a
# PERF=1 build, the counters of the layer's `perf-kv` lines as `perf.*`, one
# record per line for a program comparing two builds (`bench.rs` documents
# the format). A run first deletes both kinds of file left by the one
# before, prints the reports at the end and says where the metrics files
# are. FILTER='<patterns>' narrows the run as it does for `make test`, e.g.
# `FILTER=stutter`.
#
# BENCH_CORPUS='<path> <path>' names real shader caches (`mtld3d_shaders.bin`)
# for the benchmarks that read them: `cold_start` under `make bench` and the
# host emitter under `make bench-host` and `make bench-ab`, which name a corpus
# the same way. Its name is the name of the directory its file sits in, the
# path resolved first (a relative one against this checkout, so a bare file
# name is named after the checkout's directory, and `~` is not expanded), with
# every character other than an ASCII letter or digit turned into `_`. Each
# target copies the caches into a `corpus` directory of its own output, one
# `<name>/mtld3d_shaders.bin` apiece, and the benchmark takes the name from
# that directory; the directory is emptied first, so a run without BENCH_CORPUS

# `make bench-ab BASE=<ref>` measures a change: the same benchmarks against
# two builds of the layer, BASE and this checkout, interleaved, and then a
# verdict per metric. RUNS (default 5) is how many rounds each benchmark gets,
# a round being one run of either build back to back, the one that goes first
# alternating, and each build's run one process running every benchmark in
# libtest's order, the same in both.
# BENCH_SET picks the benchmarks: `wow` (the default) the ones that stand for
# the game this layer serves first, `full` every benchmark, and anything else
# a space-separated list of test-name filters, each selecting the benchmarks
# whose test path contains it (BENCH_SET=dynamic_buffer_churn rechecks one),
# the words mixing freely (`wow cold_start`); a name the checkout does not
# carry yet is skipped with a note. The host emitter benchmark runs with a
# named set or a filter that is part of `host::emit_corpus`, not with a
# subset of the end-to-end ones. ACCEPT=a,b names the
# exact metrics (draw counts and the like, which the workload fixes) whose
# change is expected, and BENCH_CONFIG is appended to both legs' configuration
# as it is for `make bench`. BASE=HEAD is an A/A run, the way to see how much
# the machine moves the numbers by itself, and with uncommitted changes it
# compares them against the commit they sit on.
#
# Both legs build PROD=1 PERF=1 into ISOLATED=1 trees of their own: BASE in a
# detached worktree under the main checkout's `.codex/worktrees`, kept for
# the next run and removed by `make clean-bench-ab`, and this checkout in its
# own `.wine-isolated`. Both trees are taken down and cloned again from the
# SDK and the prefix this invocation would otherwise use on every run, and
# both prefixes are configured by this checkout's `configure-test-prefix`, so
# a Wine rebuilt since the last run, an older BASE's prefix settings or a test
# run in this checkout's prefix cannot make the legs differ in more than the
# layer; the runner checks that both run one Wine before it starts, and the
# report names it. The clones cost about a second a tree; what costs is a
# prefix's first boot, and a clone of a configured prefix only boots once
# (see `configure-test-prefix-locked`). The two legs build at the same time,
# the base's output going to `build-base.log` in the run's directory, and the
# two prefixes are configured at the same time while the benchmark binary and
# the runner build, each prefix's output going to `configure-<leg>.log` there
# and shown when it fails. The persistent
# wineservers of both prefixes are stopped when the run ends, however it
# ends. The candidate's
# benchmark binary drives both legs: it links `d3d9` by name and nothing of
# the layer's, so the workload is the same on either side. Every run checks
# that the layer it loaded carries its leg's `git describe` stamp, computed
# here the way `unix/shared/build.rs` stamps it. The two legs must also load
# two different `d3d9.dll` images, except in a true A/A run (BASE is HEAD and
# the tree is clean), where a deterministic build may give both the same one.
#
# The runs, their layer logs and the report go to a directory of their own,
# `<base>-vs-<candidate>-<time>` under LOG_DIR (default
# `.codex/evidence/bench-ab` in the main checkout, so the results outlive the
# worktree that made them). After its timed rounds every benchmark whose
# metrics declare `shape` lines runs once more per leg with the pass trace on
# (the rest of the layer at warn but for the lines that name its build and
# the perf windows, `shape.rs` has the filter), untimed and stopped once its
# log holds the steady submissions, into
# `<leg>/shape/`, and the report compares the passes and load/store decisions
# of its steady submission between the legs; a difference fails the run
# unless ACCEPT names `shape` or `shape:<bench>`. Exit 1 is a regression
# or a shape change, 2 a run or a directory that cannot be trusted. `make
# bench-compare AB_DIR=<that directory>` judges it again, shapes included,
# with another ACCEPT for instance, into a report of its own
# (`report-compare-<time>.txt`) beside the one the run wrote.
#
# The host emitter benchmark (`make bench-host`) runs in rounds of its own,
# the first benchmark processes of the run, before the end-to-end benchmarks
# and whatever BENCH_SET names (only their short `--list` under Wine comes
# before it), so that no benchmark's Wine process is still exiting while it
# times host code. It is host
# code, so each leg builds and runs its own tree's `emit_corpus` with the
# leg's profile, and BENCH_CORPUS names the shader caches both legs read
# (none: the synthetic corpora alone); the same staged copies are linked into
# every end-to-end run's directory, so `cold_start` measures them as it does
# under `make bench`. A BASE whose Makefile has no
# `bench-host-build` predates the benchmark, and then neither leg runs it.

# `make bench-variants` measures this checkout in two or three layouts
# instead of two builds: its build of one arch (x86_64 by default, i686 with
# ARCH=i686) on the SDK's Wine (the tree `bench-ab` gives its candidate), the
# same build on a clone of WINE_ARM64, and for x86_64 with EC=1 the ARM64X
# build on another clone, each tree set up as the arm64-runtime legs set theirs
# up. It runs the `bench-ab` machinery once per pair of neighbouring layouts,
# each pair into a directory of its own under `variants-<commit>-<time>` in the
# directory bench-ab writes to: `<arch>-sdk-vs-arm64` and, for x86_64 with
# EC=1, `x86_64-vs-arm64x`. The i686 pair is the path the 32-bit games take on
# an arm64 Wine, where the translator runs our i686 build. Each pair is a
# layout comparison (the runner's `--base-runtime` and the three flags beside
# it): one commit in both legs, so a binary the two layouts share runs as one
# image and is noted, the legs of two runtimes run two Wines, and the report
# names each leg's runtime and DLL variant; `make bench-compare` judges a
# pair's directory again the same way. BENCH_SET, RUNS, BENCH_CONFIG, ACCEPT
# and BENCH_WAIT_IDLE mean what they mean for `bench-ab`; the host emitter
# benchmark does not run, since no layout changes it.
#
# The two pairs answer different questions. The first mixes two things: the
# arch of the host Wine and which Wine build it is (the SDK is a patched
# CrossOver 26, WINE_ARM64 is whatever it names, a stock CrossOver 27 on the
# machines this was written for), so a difference there is not the arch's
# alone; that holds for the i686 pair as it does for the x86_64 one. The
# ARM64X pair runs one Wine in both legs and changes only our DLLs, so it
# isolates what the ARM64X build buys an x64 game.

# Take down what ISOLATED=1 left under the isolated root $(1): the Wine session

# is more than its server. Signalling the server alone leaves the service
# processes the prefix keeps (services.exe, the two winedevice.exe, plugplay.exe,
# svchost.exe, rpcss.exe) running, reparented to launchd, with their cwd in a
# prefix that is about to be deleted and their images mapped out of an SDK clone
# that is about to go with it.
#
# So the session is ended through the root's own `wineserver -k`, which takes
# the clients down with the server. The prefix is named on the command line
# rather than inherited, since the caller's WINEPREFIX is its own checkout's and
# every root this is called for may be another's. `-k` waits for the server to
# exit without a bound, and it execs a binary out of the tree that is about to
# go, so it runs in the background and gets five seconds before the helper
# itself is killed: a wedged prefix holds this root and no other. With no server
# up it returns at once and boots none.
#
# The server is then signalled by pid, which is how a root whose SDK clone is
# already gone is still taken down, and how one that did not answer `-k` ends:
# SIGTERM, five seconds, SIGKILL. A server is recognised by its executable path
# (`ps -o comm=`, one field however many spaces it holds), never by splitting a
# command line into words.

# Whatever is left is matched by what it holds open. A service process carries
# the Windows path `C:\windows\system32\winedevice.exe` as its `comm`, so its
# name says nothing about which checkout it belongs to, but its cwd is in the
# prefix and its images are mapped out of the SDK clone, and lsof reports both
# by path even once the tree is removed. Only a cwd and a mapped image count, so
# something that merely has a file under the root open is not taken for a member
# of the session. Each match is SIGTERMed, given five seconds, then SIGKILLed,
# and it is asked again for the same paths immediately before either signal, so
# a pid reused in between is left alone.
#
# The clones therefore only go once nothing is running out of them, and the one
# thing executed out of a directory that is about to be deleted is the bounded
# `-k` above. A delete can still meet files written into the tree meanwhile
# (a helper process on its way out, or macOS writing a `.DS_Store`), so it is
# tried again every half second for five seconds; a root still there after
# that fails the call, naming the processes that hold files under it (an
# `lsof +D` walk, affordable only on that path) or saying that none does. One logical shell line, so a caller that found a root of its own
# can run it inside a loop; $(1) arrives unquoted and is quoted here.

# The clones and the server of this checkout. Named after the knob rather than
# folded into `clean`, which is about cargo output and must stay usable while an
# isolated test is running.
clean-isolated:
	$(call clean_isolated_at,$(ISOLATED_ROOT))

# The same for what a removed checkout left behind. Two things can survive it:
# the clones, when the checkout went but its directory did not (a `git worktree
# remove` that only got as far as the entry, a prune, a hand-deleted `.git`),
# and the server, when the directory went but the process did not (`git worktree
# remove` takes the directory, not the process). So the environments are
# enumerated three ways, none of which needs a server to be running and none of
# which needs the checkout to still be there:
#
#   - the clones by their place on disk, one and two levels under every
#     directory that holds a checkout of this repository (the main one's parent,
#     and the parent of each worktree git lists), which is where a worktree
#     lives (`../mtld3d-foo`, `../mtld3d-issues/issue-N`) and where its
#     neighbours are left behind;
#   - the clones a checkout recorded in `ISOLATED_REGISTRY` when it made them,
#     which is the only thing that reaches a checkout kept somewhere else, and
#     is read filtered by what is still on disk;
#   - the environments by what a process of one holds open, which is all that is
#     left to name a checkout whose directory went with the worktree. A server
#     maps its own executable out of the SDK clone and the service processes it
#     leaves behind have their cwd in the prefix, so this reaches a session the
#     server no longer holds together, which asking `ps` for a name cannot: a
#     service process answers with a Windows path that names no checkout.
#
# What is still a checkout is then dropped from all three: a directory that
# carries its own `.git` that git can still resolve is in use, and its
# environment is that checkout's own `clean-isolated` to take down, never this
# sweep's. What is left is shut down through its own SDK clone while the clones
# are still there, its clones removed, and its processes signalled by pid, never
# by a pattern that could reach a checkout in use. A process is recognised by a
# path it holds, never by its command line, so an editor whose command line
# merely carries one (or this recipe under a shell) is never taken for a member
# of a session, and a path with a space in it is still one field.
#
# The list of roots is fed to the loop on a descriptor of its own with the
# loop's own input closed, so that nothing a takedown runs can read the roots
# still to come. The record is rewritten at the end to what is still on disk,
# which is how a line for a checkout that is gone leaves it.
